<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Australian Cyber League releases initial details for their 2014 ACL Pro Cricuit!</strong></span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The Australian Cyber League has always been committed to providing the biggest, most exciting and most professional gaming events in Australia. Since 2006, we've been on a never-ending learning curve, finding out the best way to bring you high quality National-scale live events. In 2014, we are more dedicated to this cause than ever, and we will outline the position of ACL for this year and what you can expect from us.<br />
<br />
With that being said ACL is pleased to release initial details on its 2014 circuit, however each event of the year will have its own full announcement. 2014 will see some changes to the typical structure that some may have grown used to over the years, however you can still expect bigger and better events than ever!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>ACL's Position in 2014:</span></strong><br />
In 2014 ACL and its core staff will be working on a myriad of eSports projects, some that tie in with the 2014 ACL Pro Circuit and some that do not. Projects ACL will be involved in throughout this year are the Call of Duty Championship, Blizzard's WCS Oceania/SEA Qualifiers and League of Legends events. All these events provide you, Australia's eSports player base, the opportunity to compete in events for the games you know and love. While they may not be typical ACL events, they are events that ACL and their staff members are working on to help push eSports in this region. As one could imagine, with so many events already scheduled in 2014 that we are involved in, we have had to modify our structure to not only accommodate for these events and allow time between them, but also to dedicate our resources in a logical and even manner that doesn't effect our level of quality. We wish to ensure every ACL event has the full level of service and experience you've come to expect in the past. To be clear, ACL will be involved in the running of more eSports events in 2014 than ever before.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>The 2014 ACL Pro Circuit:</span></strong><br />
ACL is proud to announce our first National-scale live event for 2014 over the weekend of July 19th - 20th at the <strong class='bbc'>Australian Technology Park</strong> in Sydney. <br />

<br />
That's right, the venue of Blizzard's WCS Australia & Oceania Finals returns for the largest ACL event to date. We will be utilising three separate, though conjoining, rooms at the Australian Technology Park. So each game will have its own room, with its own crowd, with its own mainstage! <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Spectating:</strong>[<br />
Come down and check out all the gaming action in person! There is no charge for spectating at this event.<br />
<br />

<br />
Further details will be released in closer to the event! For now, save the date and get organising, this is going to be one event you do not want to miss!<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Additional Events in 2014:</span></strong><br />
Don't worry, we will not only be running one official live event in 2014. These live events, which could host single or multiple games, will seed players and teams towards the National live event in Sydney in July.<br />
<br />
ACL Brisbane has been announced for May 31st - June 1st. Find more information about ACL Brisbane <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-brisbane-2014-r302' class='bbc_url' title=''>here</a></strong></span>.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Online Rounds in 2014:</span></strong><br />
We have listened, read, and gathered your feedback from 2013 and are going to implement this community feedback towards our Online Rounds in 2014. Typically, ACL has specialised in live events and used our Online Rounds as a tool to seed competitors for our LANs. This year we want to concentrate more on providing competitors with a better Online tournament experience. Our first series of Online Rounds will have their own individual announcement in the following weeks, so keep your eyes peeled!<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>2014 & Beyond:</span></strong><br />
Since 2009 Australian Cyber League, whether combined with the efforts of publishers or solo, has brought you some of the largest and most prestigious live events our region has ever seen. This is our passion, this is what we love to do. We have been doing it for 5 years and we hope to be doing it for at least another 5 years to come. We hope you are as excited as we are for 2014 and all the gaming action it will present for competitors. So get ready, get hyped and keep a look out for further announcements regarding the information we have provided above for the 2014 ACL Pro Circuit!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/H1dul5W.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<em class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 17px;'>In our second interview we've sought out our British resident Fenner to see how he plans to be the best StarCraft II player to ever grace the planet. Want to find out more about WCS in Oceania/South East Asia in 2014? For full details including registrations go to <a href='http://wcs2014.aclpro.com.au' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>wcs2014.aclpro.com.au</a></span></em><br />
<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Thanks for allowing me to interview you Fenner! Can you say a little bit about yourself to start things off?</strong><br />
My pleasure Mr Baldwin. Hello, people of the internets. My name is Daniel Fenner and I like to play StarCraft 2. I'm a Zerg player representing team Frenetic Array. I'm British, living in Australia and my goal in life is to be the best SC2 player to ever grace the planet.<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>That's a bold statement if I ever heard one! Have you always been this competitive?</strong><br />
I guess I've always been competitive, but when I was younger never really pushed myself to try and be at the top. As for things I've played competitively before, I played (in my earliest days) AVP2, CS and then Poker before coming to StarCraft... But I never dedicated myself to any of those like I did with SC2. They were more of a casual competitive outlet, yknow? Where as with SC2 I've just decided to go all out. <br />
<br />
It's quite a cool story actually. I was really into photography a couple of years ago, so I was practicing it a lot and was on the edge of starting up my own photography business. But around that time I was absolutely loving SC2. I was watching the GSL with a good friend and I let out a comment something along the lines of "I wish I could be competing there!" and my friend just said "Do it!." Since I was at a point where I didn't yet have responsibilities etc. I felt like this was my only chance to give the dream a shot. It's funny how 2 little words can change the course of your life, haha.<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>I have a few similar moments myself which have shapped where I am today so I know what you mean. What makes StarCraft II the game worthy of dedicating your life to?</strong><br />
I'm not sure. I don't think the game or sport of choice is important, just as long as it has enough competition to where winning a major tournament would have a lot of meaning. SC2 is just the competitive thing I was into at the time so it was only natural.<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Do you ever wonder how your life would look right now if your friend didn't say those two words?</strong><br />
To be honest I don't really think about it. It's hard for me to think what I would be doing instead, there is way too much I want to do  I think I would be enjoying a lot more cash money though if I wasn't on the path of #dedication. <br />
<br />
Then again thinking about it now, probably would go down the photography route or video fx, graphic design, 3d modelling/animation - I enjoy all of those a lot.<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Thanks for giving us a little glimpse of your life outside of StarCraft II! Speaking of which; given you want to be the best player to ever grace the planet, these upcoming WCS qualifiers must be pretty important to you? What would it mean for you to be able to qualify for WCS America?</strong><br />
Yeah, these qualifiers have such a huge meaning to me. If I was able to qualify I would be absolutey ecstatic. The ultimate goal of waking up and practicing everyday is to take down a major tournament, to feel the sensation of all that hard work paying off. <br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>How has your preparation been going for you?</strong><br />
I've been practicing what I would call quite a decent amount, looots of ladder. My play still feels extremely weak and with the strong competition in this qualify I need to really push myself this next upcoming week. My ZvT suddenly became incredibly weak due to people playing a lot more aggressive nowadays with Hellion Banshee etc. instead of just the old school 3cc into bio marine train which was a lot easier to deal with. My ZvP is strange, there is so much that can happen in a ZvP that it mostly comes down to the player you're against, I think vs any macro player I'm fine but someone who likes his cheese may be much more difficult. My ZvZ is in a weird spot too, not exactly weak but my go to build is weaker in the current metagame - but I'm already changing that and feeling much stronger.<br />
<br />
Over the next week I hope I can find some prac partners willing to play 8 hour sessions with me so I can just practice specific matchups. I think that would be a great way to practice!<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sounds like the #dedication required to make an impact in these qualifiers! You mention the strong competition. Are you confident with your chances of qualifying?</strong><br />
My confidence will be based on how well my practice goes this week, so if like you say that my practice goes well then I will most definitely be confident to qualify. So I damn well better make sure my practice goes well! <br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Is there anybody you really want to battle, perhaps a rival?</strong><br />
Hmmm. The people I really want to play would be moonglade/mafia since they always knocked me out in tournaments before, but it's doubtful they will even be competing. Other than that I guess Rossi. For whatever reason whenever I play Rossi in a tournament we always end up having some really ridiculous games, probably because he NEVER gives up even if he goes down to like 1 SCV. Playing against him is extremely frustrating but after the game I realize how much fun it is from the spectator POV ;D<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>There rarely is a dull series when it's a TvZ involving Rossi! These WCS qualifiers you will also be competing against some of the remainder of South East Asia's best which you don't usually play within the Australian Cyber League circuit. What are your thoughts on the idea of opening up ACL to all of South East Asia?</strong><br />
Sounds like a great idea. More players = more challenge = more prestige from winning! <br />
<br />
There are some strong players in the rest of SEA, most notably Blysk and Enderr. Man, I really do not want to play Enderr... His play in SC2 is batshit insane, completely unpredictable. If he is going to come to an ACL offline event, I hope his personality doesn't reflect his ingame playstyle <br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Thank you for your time and I wish you the best with your practice this week! Let's hope these qualifiers are a step closer to the realisation of your goal. Do you have any closing comments?</strong><br />
Thanks mate~ <br />
Shoutout to ACL for making this happen and all the great events they run throughout the year. <br />
Shoutout to SC2SEA for being the best community site ever, always enjoy reading ye olde chatbox. <br />
Shout out to Frenetic Array, umart online and Razer! Peace y'all. y'all.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/H1dul5W.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<em class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 17px;'>We recently sat down with one of the four South East Asian invites for the upcoming WCS America qualifiers to learn a bit about what it's like competing and Singapore and his thoughts on WCS in 2014. Want to find out more about WCS in Oceania/South East Asia in 2014? For full details including registrations go to <a href='http://wcs2014.aclpro.com.au' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>wcs2014.aclpro.com.au</a></span></em><br />
<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>For those out there who perhaps aren't as familiar with you as others, can you say a little bit about yourself?</strong><br />
Heya guys, I'm Revenant from Singapore. I'm currently 21 and serving my mandatory national service. <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> For now, I'm temporarily playing in FlashWolves's academy division for practice, but I'm pretty much a free agent for now! *wink wink* <br />
<br />
2013 has been quite a silent year for me due to a lack of time, but with 2014 coming, I'm rather motivated to perform to the fullest of my abilities!<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>You mention motivation. Living in Singapore it's probably safe to say there are less major competitive opportunities for you than say somebody who lives in Sydney. What are some of the challenges you face and how hard is it to stay motivated?</strong><br />
In Singapore, it is indeed tough to stay motivated or simply interested in the game. That being said, many talented players like Yekke, Drake, Kyzer have all been wiped off. Year by year, there has been lesser major tournaments. As such, even though I've been playing since the start of Wings of Liberty, I've been off and on in terms of activeness. <br />
<br />
On a personal level, once you enter the working society, sometimes you stop to think; Will all these time I invest into my passion be worth it? It seems all that all these time will have minimal ROI. :/<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>In 2012 you had direct qualifiers which fed into WCS Asia, 2013 Blizzard tried the vengeance cup and with the reworked WCS System for 2014 you now merge with Australia and New Zealand to have a direct feed in qualifier for WCS America. </strong><br />
With a good shot at making it into the WCS America system, does this ease your ROI concerns?<br />
<br />
It's true that WCS has changed for the better in 2014 as compared to 2013, but I felt that 2012 was the best WCS system for SEA players because it gave all players an equal shot at representing their own country. <br />
<br />
As for what I meant by ROI, I don't really mean something tangible to be gotten outta competitive gaming, but rather, some sense of fulfillment/satisfaction for the amount of hours you put in. As you know,  Starcraft2 is one of the more competitive games out there, and you'd need to put in more hours to accomplish anything. Of course, at the end of the day, it's not all that cycnical as I'm still happy about the time spent as I did something for my passion. <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /><br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Do you think it's enough to promote new players to enter the competitive scene and old players to keep playing in 2014?</strong><br />
I feel that there will be lesser new players coming up in 2014 for Singapore, at least much less than compared to 2012.<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Let's focus now on these upcoming WCS Qualifiers. Firstly, being seeded straight into the Round of 16, what do you think of your chances of clinching one of the three spots for WCS America?</strong><br />
I'm still unsure of where I stand compared to the other SEA players right now since I haven't been that active in the SEA scene. That being said, I'd say the favourite to qualify from the qualifiers are probably KingKong, PiG and iaguz.<br />
<br />
However, I'll try my best to cause an upset. <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /><br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Is there anybody you would like to battle against or somebody you consider a rival?</strong><br />
Enderr. I'm coming for my revenge. ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Finally with WCS America Qualifiers opening the gates to the remainder of South East Asia outside of Australia and New Zealand, do you think there's merit in the Australian Cyber League opening up their competitions to people such as yourself in 2014?</strong><br />
It'd definitely be great news for SEA players that are outside Oceania to be able to participate in Oceania competitions such as ACL as it gives us more motivation to play. It's gonna be great to be able to have some form of major competitions around SEA again.<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Would you be willing to make the journey to Australia if you qualified for a regional event?</strong><br />
I'd definitely travel to Australia if I had the chance to! I've always wanted to go Australia in 2013, and it's one of my #NewYearResolutions to travel to Australia in 2014 if I'm able to!!<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Thank you for your time! I look forward to seeing you compete in a few weeks. If you have any shoutouts or plugs now's the time to do it!</strong><br />
Thank you for the interview! It's been awhile, and I'll try my hardest! <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /><br />

<strong class='bbc'>CoD: Black Ops 2</strong><br />
8 teams invite only. 4 teams will be invited from Yearly points (Season 1, Season 2 and Season 3) and 4 teams will be invited from Season 3 points (Online Round 5 & Online Round 6). There is a possibility that an Open Bracket will exist. Details are outlined below.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Open Bracket Possibilities:</span></strong></span><br />
At the beginning of 2013, the Sydney event was announced as invite only. This event marks the culmination of the entire year’s competition and those teams who have accumulated season points through good placings and repeat attendance are invited to attend. ACL maintains that these teams and players who have earned their spot deserve to be recognised for their efforts throughout the year.<br />
<br />
We have noticed an overwhelming demand for the existence of an open bracket system, particularly for Call of Duty but also some Starcraft gamers. We acknowledge these requests, and are willing to incorporate an open bracket for these games provided some conditions are met. <br />
<br />
As an organisation wanting to push the envelope for production values and entertainment, the idea behind our finals series is to create a top quality stream and live atmosphere for each of our Pro Circuit titles. Having an open bracket drains our resources and means this is not feasible with our current level of supporters and volunteers. Combined with the time pressures of setup and packdown, we are often understaffed for these kinds of setups. This was a critical factor for us at ACL Melbourne and resulted in severe burnout from our core team. The impact of these pressures means over-tired staff and less effective performance for production – something we wanted to alleviate for our finals.<br />
<br />
In order for us to effectively run open brackets, I would ask the following of the community:<br />
-	We have minimum 1 additional admin volunteer for the running of each tournament (CoD & SC2)<br />
-	We have minimum 5 volunteers (each game) help setup the open bracket play area on Friday 18th October. This is approximately 5-6 hours work.<br />
-	We have minimum 5 volunteers (each game) help packdown the open bracket play area on the evening of Sunday 20th October. This is approximately 3-4 hours work.<br />
<br />
If we can meet these conditions we will open up open bracket play for Saturday 19th October for a limited number of players/teams, whereby some will advance to the Championship bracket. To ensure the provision of these measures, we would then require pre-payment.<br />
<br />
If you feel you can contribute to the ACL team in any of the ways above, please send through an email to <strong class='bbc'>info@aclpro.com.au</strong>. In a similar vein, we are also looking for help with production (video, streaming etc) and if this interests you please shoot through an email reflecting this.<br />

<br />
ACL has heard the calls for an Open Bracket for Starcraft 2 and CoD: Black Ops 2 and put it to the community to pitch in to make it happen. Since this announcement, we have received numerous responses from active community members wishing to put their hands up to help. Although we have <span class='bbc_underline'>NOT YET</span> locked in the required amount of volunteers necessary to go ahead with a limited Open Bracket for both titles ACL is taking it in good faith that we can lock in the final few volunteers to ensure we are not understaffed for the communities requests and are announcing tonight a limited Open Bracket for Starcraft 2 and CoD: Black Ops 2.</strong></span> </span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Starcraft 2:</span></strong><br />
Starcraft 2 at ACL Sydney has already been advertised to invite the top 16 players based on ACL Season Points for the top 8 and ACL Season 3 Points (Online 5 & 6) for the bottom 8. ACL is now proud to announce that it will open its doors to an additional 32 players (48 players in total for the event) in a limited open bracket that will be hosted and completed on Saturday of ACL Sydney. More details regarding the the process of determining the 32 players for the Open Bracket will be released shortly. <br />
<br />
From the Open Bracket 8 players will progress to Sunday and play in the Championship Bracket for Starcraft 2. The Championship Bracket will feature the top 16 invited players and the 8 players that progressed from the Open Bracket battle it out until one player is crowned the ACL Sydney Champion.<br />
<br />
We still required an additional volunteer to assist with the bump in and bump out process to finalise the Starcraft 2 team. If you are available on Friday the 18th and Sunday night on the 20th and would like to assist with this process please email info@aclpro.com.au.<br />

This tournament will host Pool Play on Saturday with the Top 12 teams, based off win/loss ratio, moving onto a Double Elimination Bracket on Sunday. The Pools will be made based off existing Season 2 points received during Online Round 3. As competitors should know each Season has its own separate Season points, so while pools are seeded on Season 2 Points, there are 4 Pro Teams for Season 2 and they will not need to play pool play. <strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>*If less than 16 teams sign up, all teams will be required to participate in Pool Play.</span></strong><br />
<br />
You will not be awarded forfeit wins for teams that do not show up to Pool Play.<br />
<br />
Placement Matches <strong class='bbc'>MUST</strong> be played in the Double Elimination Bracket. If you choose not to play in your Placement Matches then you forfeit your chance to place the highest position available once knocked out and consequently will be awarded less ACL Season and Yearly points.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>It has been a long time coming and now here it is the first official ACL Online Round for the illustrious title League of Legends! Jumping straight into Season 2 of the ACL Pro Circuit we are coming out in full force hosting two Online Rounds for League of Legends as well as hosting the title at our upcoming ACL Live Event, <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/topic/20688-plantronics-acl-melbourne/' class='bbc_url' title=''>Plantronics ACL Melbourne</a></strong></span>! The preceding two Online Rounds (this one, with one more to follow) leading up to Plantronics ACL Melbourne will seed your teams to this invite only event, so sign up, get practicing and prepare yourselves for the 2013 ACL Pro Circuit!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'>The 2013 Pro Circuit has kicked off and has now completed its first season. Although League of Legends was not a title throughout Season 1 it is important that LoL players familiarise themselves with our 3 Season structure to have a better understanding moving forward as we look to make League of Legends one of our premier titles. ACL League of Legends Online Round 1 (this event), and ACL League of Legends Online Round 2 (not yet announced) of Season 2, this current season, will award players Season and Yearly Points based on their placement in these tournaments. Plantronics ACL Melbourne, the Live Event of Season 2, is an invite only event for League of Legends and will invite the Top 16 ranked teams based on Season 2 points (Online Round 1 & 2 results) to participate at Melbourne. Similarly, the National FINAL event of 2013, to be hosted in Sydney, will also be invite only however this event will foremost invite teams with the highest Yearly Season Points (Season 2 & Season 3 combined), than on standalone Season 3 points. This 3 Season structure is designed to award teams that succeed in each individual Season leading up to the ACL National FINAL Event where teams that have performed consistently and strongly all year are rewarded the most.<br />
<br />
ACL League of Legends Online Round 1 - Season 2 is open to unlimited registrations and will be run over 2 days featuring two different stages of competition. The first leg of the tournament is Pool Play, where teams will be placed in a Pool of 4-6, depending on sign up numbers, in which all teams will play each other in a Round Robbin. Based on win/loss ratio, the Top 16 teams from Pool Play will advance to an Double Elimination Bracket and will play out the bracket until a Champion is crowned. This tournament will reward participants with valuable Season and Yearly Points that will put high placing players in the best position coming into our second Live event of 2013. For this online round we will use existing League of Legends leagues, such as Cybergamer, to ensure that Pool Play is seeded accurately and fairly, giving all teams the best chance to advancing to the Double Elimination bracket.</span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'><span class='bbc_underline'>Details:</span></span></strong><br />
This is the first of two official Online Rounds of Season 2. This tournament will award ACL Season 2 points as well as yearly points. Yearly points will seed payers at the National FINAL event at the end of year (Season 3), however the Season 2 National events will be seeded by its preceding Online Rounds. After Season 2 Online Round 1 & Online Round 2 have been completed, Season points will be added up and used to seed players at the second live National event in August, Plantronics ACL Melbourne. League of Legends will be added to <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://stats.aclpro.com.au/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Stats Central</a></strong></span>, where players can see their Season and Yearly points updated throughout the year. <br />

<strong class='bbc'>Date: </strong> Saturday the 15th of June & Sunday the 16th of June.<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Stages:</strong> Saturday: Pool Play, Sunday: Double Elimination, with Double Elimination continuing on Monday night if necessary. <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Time:</strong> 10:30am AEST - 10.30pm AEST. <br />
<br />
10.30pm is the latest the tournament will be played to unless all players left agree to continue. If players do not agree to continue matches will be rescheduled at the earliest possible convenience. Players entering and competing in this tournament are obligated to play until AT LEAST 10.30 AEST and if you choose to leave before this time you will be penalised. <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'><span class='bbc_underline'>Tournament Structure:</span></span></strong><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play:</strong><br />
Each team will be placed into a Pool of 4-6 teams, depending on signups numbers. In each Pool all teams play each other in a Best of 1 series in a Round Robbin system. Once Pool Play is competed the best performing teams, based on Win/Loss ration, will progress to the Double Elimination Bracket. Teams are not awarded 'no show' wins, meaning if a team does not show up to their match teams are awarded no wins and no losses. In the same fashion, results will only be counted if a teams play 2/3, 3/4 or 4/5 (depending of Pool size) of their scheduled matches. If a team chooses to stop participating before this point all their results will be discounted and teams that competed against teams that leave early will be awarded no wins and no losses for these matches. If uneven numbers dictate that some Pools are required to be larger than others there is no advantage or disadvantage to a small or larger pool, as results are based on a Win/Loss ratio, not a number of games won/lost. For Teams tied after Pool Play seeding will be awarded based on pre-tournament seeding going into the competition, which will see the higher seeded team being awarded the higher seed of the tied teams and the lower seeded team receiving the lower seed. This rule will not count for Teams that tie within the same Pool, as the Team that won out of the two tied teams within the same pool will be awarded the higher seed. Tiebreaker games for tied teams after Pool Play are only required to be played for a position that may determine progressing to the Double Elimination bracket or not, meaning for example if two teams are tied for 16th/17th seed after Pool Play they will be required to play a 1 game tiebreaker instead of pre-tournament seeding determining which team progresses. These Tiebreaker games are to be played Saturday afternoon/evening.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination:</strong><br />
The Double Elimination bracket will seed the Top 16 teams based on Pool Play results. This stage of the competition will play out like a typical Double Elimination Bracket where teams will have one life in the Winners Bracket, meaning if you lose in the Winners Bracket you drop to the Losers Bracket where you have no lives and are knocked out once beaten in the Losers Bracket. The Double Elimination will host Best of 1 series except for the Grand Final which will host a Best of 3 series. Typical continuation rules will apply in the Double Elimination Bracket and Placement Rounds must also be played to determine exact placements between 16th - 5th.<br />

<em class='bbc'>By Baldie</em></span><br />
<br />
Season 2 kicked into gear with 71 players competing in Online Round 3 on the 19th of May. After all the hype of ACL Brisbane there was no doubt players were out for blood to capture those precious points to seed into ACL Melbourne. For the most part the day went as expected with all but one of the top 8 seeds making it to the winner bracket round of 8. The fallen one being Exile 5 PiG who was, for many, surprisingly beaten by Auxiliary Tigey 2-1 in the round of 16. PiG commented, in jest, about the set on his twitter:<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/LayMwXO.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
 <br />
PiG then fought through the higher end of the losers bracket before having to forfeit due to family commitments, finishing in a respectable 5th position.<br />
<br />
Another big talking point was Terran powerhouse Frenetic Array Iaguz one again being forced to play the zerg powerhouse Xeria Gaming KingKong. It seems both these players find it difficult avoiding each other in brackets having now played each other five times over the four ACL tournaments this year. Never have these two failed to impress with their gameplay and Online Round 3 was no different with three exceptional matches resulting in a 2-1 victory to Iaguz. For those of you wondering the set score sits at 4-1 in favour of Iaguz with all sets going to the third map. Iaguz placed 6th overall with KingKong lower at 9th.<br />
<br />

<br />
Immunity Light continued to impress with his solid Protoss play proving to SEA that Protoss does have a home in SEA winning 67% of his maps and advancing to the winner bracket finals. Being narrowly defeated by Ninja 2-1, Light's second chance was to beat lower bracket winner Frenetic Array Petraeus. another Zerg. Unfortunately unable to take out Petraeus either Light was forced to settle as the highest non Zerg with a stellar 3rd.<br />
<br />
With over 1,000 people watching live on twitch - the highest of any ACL SC2 tournament to date excluding WCS - the grand finalists in Frenetic Array Ninja and team-mate Petraeus needed to bring the action. Petraeus coming from the losers bracket had to win two best of threes to claim victory - something few players achieve. Petraeus showed he was in for business in game one on Bel'Shir Vestige taking the game in 7 minutes with an amazing baneling flank to trap all of Ninja's zerglings. With solid micro and decision making, Petraeus looked like he was on a mission for revenge having lost to Ninja in the winner bracket semi finals. Ninja tried to mix things up on Daybreak for game two incorporating some Roaches into the mix in a Wings of Liberty-esque play. Unable to do the damage he needed to, Petraeus with a sizeable mutalisk ball was able to punish Ninja and eventually starve him out forcing the second best of three.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/G1ZNPAz.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
Game one of the second set on Bel'Shir Vestige turned into a 20 minute macro game consisting of what is considered the standard Heart of the Swarm ZvZ composition, mutalisks and zerglings. With the superior macro and decision making, Petraeus forced the tap out from Ninja and moved one map from victory. In game two on Daybreak Petraeus mixed things up with a zergling and baneling timing attack which was able to break through Ninja's defenses and force the final gg. <br />

<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>Written by Midnite</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>Season 2 of the 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is underway and this past Sunday we played host to the third official Call of Duty Online Round of 2013; ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 3. We saw an impressive talent pool of 44 teams from across Australia and New Zealand battle it out in the hopes of claiming the top spot as their own. </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
Once again we had valuable Season and Yearly points for the taking so teams had plenty to fight for and plenty to prove. The competition fielded the best names in Australia and New Zealand Call of Duty including the likes of Avant, Mindfreak, Noxious and the Plantronics ACL Brisbane winners, Team Immunity. This tournament was seeded by Season Points earned in Season 1, though Season 2 will carry its own individual points for Points for Players. With the existing lineups combined with new teams signing up we had an excellent tournament on our hands.<br />
<br />
Round 1 was a very tame set of matches. Almost all teams who progressed won convincingly 2-0, the closest series being Team Pulse vs Team Intervene ending 2-1 Pulse's way, paving the way for the Winners Bracket. <br />
<br />
Round 2 saw a lot more action with notable match ups including: Inspire vs Dignify, where Inspire pulled through 2-1, freQuency vs seQuence, which saw two teams with similar names battle out to the very end. freQuency edged seQuence out 2-1 moving them through to WBR3. The highlight match up would have to have been Sensual CoD Clan narrowly knocking Saikyo to the Losers Bracket in a 2-1 fashion. The other matches in WBR2 had a pretty standard result of 2-0.<br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 3 saw a very similar range of results to Round 2. The majority of matches were a straight 2-0 result, however a we did have a few close matches.<br />
Fame took out a strong rickross lineup 2-1 and Sensual CoD Clan caused somewhat of an upset knocking 4th place ACL Brisbane team Noxious to the Losers Bracket.<br />
<br />
Immunity continued their dominance moving through the Winners Bracket in Round 4, taking out Mindfreak in a 2-0 clean sweep. Fame had a close encounter with Team Emperor which ultimately saw them being knocked to the Losers Bracket as Team Emperor took the win 2-1. Coup de Grace vs Avant was a highlight grudge-match of the tournament, considering the history shared between the two teams,  however Coup De Grace proved too strong on the day walking away with a 2-0 vicoty. Myth.EP vs Sensual CoD Clan was another great matchup, which ended in Myth putting a halt to Sensual CoD Clan's winning streak by winning 2-0.<br />
<br />
Up next we had Winners Bracket Round 5, or the Winners Bracket Semi-Final. Immunity maintained their composure throughout the tournament taking out an on fire Team Emperor squad 3-0 and Coup De Grace continued their dominance bidding farewell to Myth.EP 3-0 respectively.<br />
<br />
This brings us to the Winners Bracket Final. Both Immunity and Coup de Grace had not dropped a map coming into this match so we were in for an epic match up. The match started off with what looked to be an easy 3-0 for Immunity after starting Hardpoint Slums with a 100 point lead. Coup de Grace knew if they dug deep they could bring it back and managed just that to bring control back in their favor as they took out the first map. Search and Destroy Raid was up next and Coup de Grace took it out convincingly 6-2, which some speculation and raised eyebrows at Naked's Riotsheild strat. All of sudden Immunity were one game away from being knocked to the Losers Bracket, which would of been a first for this dynasty of a squad. Immunity decided today was not going to be that day as the stepped up their game taking out Game 3 Capture the Flag Standoff with an easy 5 captures. In Game 4 Hardpoint Yemen was extremely close for the majority of the game, however, Immunity started taking control towards the end of the game and took the map by 60 points. It all came down to the final map; Search and Destroy Standoff. The map started off going round for round before Immunity took 3 straight to make it 5-2. Coup de Grace were dropping like flies leaving Ray in a 1v3 situation. Ray managed to take down Shockz before being baited in by Naked's Riotshield and getting cleaned up by Fighter. Team Immunity take out the Winners Bracket Final winning three straight rounds and earning themselves a spot in the Grand Final.<br />
<br />
Moving on to Losers Bracket Round 1. Traumatize were the only team to put up a fight before being knocked out by Infinite. The other teams all advanced to Losers Bracket Round 2.<br />
Losers Bracket Rounds 2-4 were much of the same. The vast majority of matches were 2-0 clean sweeps with very few seeing any major competition.<br />
<br />
Coming into Losers Bracket Round 5 we were finally in for some great CoD. Mindfreak and Avant beat their opponents 3-0 advancing them to the next round. Noxious had to work for their spot in the next round after Fame took a round from them early on. Noxious progressed after a 3-1 win. NoChance and Sensual CoD Clan saw one of the best matches of the tournament up next. Both teams were playing superbly, bringing the match to the 5th and final map. NoChance pulled through securing their spot in the tournament with SCC being knocked out.<br />
<br />
LBR6 continued the trend with a couple of impressive match ups. Noxious vs Mindfreak and Avant vs NoChance. Noxious took out Mindfreak with relative ease, only dropping one map however Avant were not so lucky. Vilesyder's mid-series disappearance act did them no favours as NoChance were here for the win and fought right down to the last map. Avant managed to take it out 3-2 but it was an excellent match to watch, with lots of cheeky smack talk thrown around in game and on twitter.<br />
<br />
The next round in the Losers Bracket saw Noxious and Avant continue their dominance. Team Emperor stood no chance against Avant’s momentum ending their journey in a 3-0 fashion. Myth.EP were ready for a fight and slowed Noxious right down taking the match to the final map. Noxious proved to be too strong and took it out winning the match 3-2.<br />
<br />
Losers Bracket Semi Finals were up next with both Noxious and Avant ready to battle it out for a top 3 finish. Avant were riding their momentum and looked unstoppable coming into this match but Noxious were here to prove otherwise, starting to really their grove. Dominating Avant 3-0 knocking them out of the tournament and advancing themselves to the Losers Bracket Finals.<br />
<br />
Noxious were in a great mindset and their match vs Coup de Grace looked to be a great one for spectators. Noxious looked good but unfortunately for them it wasn't enough. Coup de Grace were just too strong all tournament long and this series was no different as they took out Noxious 3-0 advancing to the Grand Final.<br />
<br />
The Grand Final was up next and because both teams had met previously this was to be a continuation series. After being dropped to the Losers Bracket by Team Immunity, Coup de Grace were down 3-2 and wanted revenge. They started CTF Slums strong, taking out the game and bringing the series back 3 a piece. Immunity seemed to need a quick warm up and proved that by taking Hardpoint Raid after a 160 point lead. This summed up the rest of the Grand Final with Immunity taking Search and Destroy Express 6-2 and with hardly any winning confidence shown by Coup De Grace in Game 9 also taking out CTF Raid 5-2. As the dust settled, Immunity walked away ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 3 - Season 2 Champions winning the Grand Final 6-3.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Team Immunity for gaining yet another tournament win under their belts, doing so only dropping 3 maps the entire tournament and Coup de Grace for taking the 2nd place finsh and being the only team strong enough to take maps of Immunity. The Top 24 results can be seen below:<br />

ACL Black Ops 2 Online Showcase Matches will continue on a (hopefully) weekly basis from the first addition. The biggest hurdle to overcome to keep these live-streams consist is securing skilled commentators to highlight the gameplay. These commentators must be experienced, knowledgeable, and display fluent commentator skills and if successful this opportunity could lead to commentating at live events. If you feel you fit these prerequisites you may apply by submitting a sample of your work (can be either a live stream rebroadcast or a youtube video) by adding Beware to skype on 'damiencauci'. You do not need to have the capabilities to stream to commentate, at the moment streaming will be done by ACL. Bio Acid will not be around forever and is not always available, we need more than one CoD Caster in ANZ.]]></description>

The Pools will be made based off points received during Season 1. As this is the first Online Round of Season 2 all teams will be placed in Pool Play.

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-family: Lucida Console'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Plantronics ACL Brisbane Wrap Up</strong></span></span></span></span><br />
<span class='bbc_center'>Written by Baldie, Neon, Hoggy & Midnite</span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is underway and our first stop of the year was in Brisbane at the Mercure Hotel over April 13th-14th for Platronics ACL Brisbane! Plantronics Gamecom provided an abundance of their fantastic products for gamers to utlise as well as a heavy contribution to the $9000 prize pool up for grabs over the weekend. BenQ also provided their amazing RL2450H monitors for the Starcraft II, CoD: Black Ops 2 & Halo mainstage, which meant competitors were in for a treat.</strong></span></span><br />
Plantronics ACL Brisbane went off with a bang and showcased an incredible weekend of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Halo 4 and Starcraft II boasting some of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand. This is event saw the first National scale live event for all 3 titles and was the first chance for players and teams to prove themselves and stand out from the rest of the crowd in 2013. Coming into the event we saw 52 of Australia and New Zealand's best Stacraft II players turn up, all gunning for that number 1 spot. In a scene that had predominantly been dominated by big names such as mOOnGLaDe, PiG, Mafia, Tgun did any new or upcoming players have what it takes to take down these juggernauts in the new expansion? Looking at Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and the slight shift in team changes from Modern Warfare 3 to Black Ops 2 who could confidently say they were the best of the best? All eyes were on Immunity of course, but this was their first Australia LAN in a new game to prove themselves. Halo 4 was a mixed bag of tricks as the scene had completely changed from Halo: Reach to Halo 4. Some big names were gone, and some big names had made way for themselves in the new title, but this would be the first event that would definitively decide who was the best. <br />
<br />

<br />
Over 150 competitors walked through the doors of Plantronics ACL Brisbane and this was everyone's first chance to be crowned champions. With $9000 in prize money available across all titles and vital Season and Yearly Points that would benefit players all year long on the table players had a lot riding on their performance and the results of this weekend.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://oi33.tinypic.com/23vb0r9.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
It's 8.30am on a Brisbane Saturday morning and gamers eagerly wait to enter the Mercure Hotel for a weekend of gaming. Pro Players start to make their way into the venue receiving their special pro zone passes as general players register for the open bracket. Signups close at 10.30am and the weekend is decided. Starcraft 2 would see 16 pre-seeded pros await their remaining 8 opponents in a 36 man open bracket. Game on.<br />
<br />
There were lots of changes to Plantronics ACL Brisbane, the first of three seasons on the 2013 circuit. This event saw the implementation of two sets on stage, noise cancelling headphones and player cam TVs on either end of the stage. Not to forget the brand new Pro Zone and retreat area for the top 16 Starcraft 2 pros to utilize.<br />
<br />
The day starts with a double elimination open bracket. This was sure to be one of the fiercest open brackets with names such as Nv.Rossi, Nv.Deth, Nv.JazBas along with New Zealand Protoss player xGKing.Stallion fighting amongst the pack. There was also a special guest from Germany called Teddy who messaged ACL staff expressing interest to play. As a backpacker he had no mouse or keyboard so was allowed to borrow equipment from Staff. We had no idea how well this man was about to play! <br />
<br />
The first game on stream would be none other than Rossi, a Terran powerhouse, against Myth.ZenAku, a rising Protoss player. There was no doubt in a lot of people's minds that Rossi was the favourite in this best of 3, however ZenAku had a point to prove. Taking the first game, ZanAku looked strong to take the set however Rossi rallied winning back-to-back wins to take the set 2-1. Rossi remained on stage to then take on his round 2 opponent; Av.Pezz, another strong Protoss player. This time Rossi was unable to deliver the goods and was knocked to the lower brackets with a 0-2 defeat.<br />
<br />
Rossi would then spend the remainder of the day fighting his way through lower brackets. He became one of the great Day 1 stories the tournament not dropping a single map while in the lower bracket until the finals! To put that in perspective he went into the open bracket finals with a map score of 20-4! Speaking of open bracket finals, Rossi's opponent would be his teammate Nv.JazBas who remained in the winners bracket with a map score of 10-2. Both players decided they best save their energy for pool play and made a gentleman's agreement to split the open bracket winnings between each other and move into separate groups.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Open Bracket Top 8 with selected pool:</strong><br />
1.	Nv. JazBas - A<br />
2.	Nv.Rossi - C<br />
3.	Teddy - A<br />
4.	Av.NXZ - C<br />
5.	Azz - B<br />
6.	FvR.Shockwave - B<br />
7.	SLCN.Petrify - D<br />
8.	Nv.Deth - D<br />
<br />
Another new format change to ACL Brisbane in 2013 was the earlier start of the Pool Stage with the top 16 playing as many games as possible at the same time as the open bracket. As the remainder of open bracket played out, attention from the stream shifted to the games people wanted to see the most. We saw matches streamed with competitors such as mOOnGLaDe, MaFia and Light fighting it out.<br />
<br />
First pool play game on stream was iM.tgun vs AuX.MegaFonzie. Tgun was quick to show his innovation taking the first game with some arguably uncommon mass mutalisk play. Second game was also an interesting strategy with nydus/swarm host/queen play. With a 2-0 victory tgun was on his way to a top 8 birth however some mixed results led to a situation where tgun was relying on other results for him to advance. Needing NXZ to lose to x5.PiG to advance, tgun was noticeably uncomfortable. Having come out of open bracket and through pool play, NXZ was surprising everybody and with 2-1 wins over tgun and TN.nomad and 2-0 wins over PiG and MegaFonzie. Unfortunately for tgun NXZ 2-0 win against PiG secured a NXZ the 2nd seed spot out of groups, knocking tgun into the 3rd place seed.<br />
<br />
Group D, considered the group of Death by many, consisted of iM.MaFia, xGKing.KingKong, fray'fenner, fray'Iaguz, joined by open bracket seeds SLCN.Petrify and Deth. This proved to be the biggest slugfest for 2 of the championship seeds. When groups were revealed Iaguz was feeling extremely confident and made a comment about the status of Zerg in HotS and that "KingKong is the only Zerg who can micro". MaFia returned fire with "I don't think I've ever lost to Iaguz in a tournament before". From there a grudge match was born. Close to $500 in bets flooded the SC2SEA scene in the week leading into ACL Brisbane, making Iaguz vs MaFia the most anticipated set of the event. Iaguz made short work of MaFia with some strong play and perhaps the help of some money mine hits taking the set 2-0, knocking MaFia out of contention for championships.<br />
<br />
Other groups saw some great sets with a total of 3 open bracket seeds making championship round (Deth, JazBas and NXZ) making it the most of any ACL event to date. Teddy narrowly missed making it out of groups losing one more map than JazBas and fray'Petraeus looked unstoppable sweeping his group without dropping a single map. mOOnGLaDe looked strong as expected losing only to iM.Light.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play Top 8:</strong><br />
1.	fray'Petraeus<br />
2.	iM.Light<br />
3.	x5.PiG<br />
4.	xGKing.KingKong<br />
5.	Av.NXZ<br />
6.	Nv.Deth<br />
7.	Nv.JazBas<br />
8.	Nv.mOOnGLaDe<br />
<br />
The time had come for the top 8 players of ACL Brisbane to fight it out for their share of $2,500. 6 Zergs, 1 Protoss and 1 Terran. Another double elimination bracket meant players still had two chances to make it to the finals. On stage Light took on JazBas with a 2-1 victory to JazBas while off stage Petraeus 2-1'd mOOnGLaDe, KingKong 2-0'd NXZ and PiG 2-0'd Deth. Arguable favourite KingKong maintained his strong performances staying in the winners bracket to the grand finals taking out Petraeus and PiG 2-1 and 2-0 respectively.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the lower bracket the two non-Zergs in Light and Deth were forced to fight and as a result the only Terran hope was defeated. NXZ surprised everybody taking out mOOnGLaDe 2-0 and he wasn't finished there, continuing to take out JazBas 2-0 before being stopped by Light 1-2. NXZ showed off a valiant effort from coming through the open brackets and pool play to finish 4th.<br />
<br />
In the lower bracket finals the final Protoss hope in Light was defeated earning him a 3rd place finish. The grand finals had the potential to be somewhat of a story similar to ACL Melbourne in 2012 where PiG won back-to-back best of 3s. However in this case KingKong proved to be too strong taking it out 2-0 in the first best of 3.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Championship Bracket Top 8:</strong><br />
1.	xGKing.KingKong<br />
2.	x5.PiG<br />
3.	iM.Light<br />
4.	Av.NXZ<br />
5.	fray'Petraeus<br />
6.	Nv.JazBas<br />
7.	Nv.mOOnGLaDe<br />
8.	Nv.Deth<br />
<br />
Overall many considered Plantronics ACL Brisbane to be the best ACL event since Starcraft 2 was brought onto the circuit in early 2012. There are some changes and improvements to be made along the way but this looks like it could be a big year for ACL and Starcraft 2!<br />

With $3,500 and valuable Season and Yearly points up for grabs this gave teams plenty to fight for, plenty to prove and spectators plenty of action to enjoy for Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. The competition fielded some of the best names in Australia and New Zealand Call of Duty including the likes of AVANT.GARDE, Myth.WF, Noxious Gaming and Team Immunity who recently competed in the CoD Championships in LA.<br />
<br />
With 17 teams signed up for Plantronics ACL Brisbane teams had to fight through Pool Play to determine seeds for the Double Elimination Bracket.. Team Immunity, Myth.WF, AVANT.GARDE and NoChance already secured themselves the top seeds through Season Points earned through placing highly in the ACL Online Rounds, which meant they did not have to participate in Pool Play and were guaranteed the seeds 1st - 4th in the Double Elimination bracket.  <br />
<br />
Saturday morning saw teams seeded 5th-17th battle it out in Pool Play. With 2 pools of 4 teams and 1 of 5 players were in for an intense day of competition. Fame and Noxious plowed through their respective pools, with their results tied these teams had to face off in a tiebraker to determine the 5th seed going through to the Double Elimination Bracket. Hardpoint Standoff was the tiebreak match with Noxious taking it out in a fairly convincing fashion.<br />
 <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Seeds going into the Double Elimination Bracket:</strong><br />
<br />
1.	Team Immunity<br />
2.	Myth.WF<br />

<br />
Double Elimination started with the lowest seeds, Tac5 and Hydra eSports, fighting to make it into Winners Bracket Round 2 with all the other teams. Tac5 started the day off strong forcing Hydra into the Losers Bracket and moving into Round 2.<br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 2 was almost a clean sweep across the board. Inspire were the only team to take a map from their opponent, Trident.tb.<br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 3 saw Immunity and AVANT continue their dominance taking out their opponents 3-0. Myth and Cruelty Infearnate had an amazing matchup, with both teams tied an even 2-2 in the series the match went right down to the line. Myth managed to pull through and knock Cruelty Infearnate to the Losers Bracket. Noxious dropped a map against NoChance but showed their dominance beating them 3-1.<br />
<br />
Immunity continued their dominance in Winners Bracket Round 4 still not dropping a map. Myth and AVANT had a much closer series where Myth edged out AVANT 3-1 progressing them through to the Winners Bracket Final.<br />
<br />
With Team Immunity and Myth.WF in the Winners Bracket Final both teams were fighting for their spot in the Grand Final. Team Immunity looking very strong and unlikely to lose a map the entire event as displayed by taking out the match convincingly 3-0.<br />
<br />
The Losers Bracket didn’t have any close match ups until Round 5. AVANT were up against NoChance and Noxious were up against Fame. After a quick couple of maps NoChance took the early lead 2-1. AVANT looked as though they were at the end of the road but brought the match back winning 3-2. Noxious knocked Fame out 3-1.<br />
<br />
Round 6 saw AVANT up against Noxious. AVANT proved to be too much and continued with their momentum taking Noxious out 3-0. <br />
<br />
The Losers Bracket Final was easily the best match up of the weekend. AVANT and Myth had already met in earlier on in the bracket making this a Best of 11 series. With Myth winning their previous match up this gave them a 3-1 advantage going into the match.They were going map for map making it 5-2 with Myth looking as though they had an easy win against AVANT. It was at this point that AVANT decided to take things into their own hands, Hopey and Vamped helped initiate a slew of amazing plays helping AVANT bring the score to 5-5. The final map, Search and Destroy on Cargo, saw teams going round for round early on but AVANT continued with their momentum and with clutch after clutch they took their place in the Grand Final against Immunity.<br />
<br />
In the Grand Finals AVANT looked as though they would be able to take it all out after their dominating display against Myth. Unfortunately for them Shockz and Fighter had a very different plan. This duo showed why they are considered the two best players in Australian Call of Duty by showing off their high level of play dropping 50 and 45 kills respectively in Game 1 of the Finals, which layed the foundations of what followed when Immunity beat out AVANT 3-0 further cementing Immunity’s place as the most dominant force Australian Call of Duty has ever scene.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Immunity for taking a very convincing first place in Plantronics ACL Brisbane without dropping a single map. Also congratulations to AVANT.GARDE who had two massive comebacks to make it into the Grand Final and take out second place. <br />

<br />
With 9 teams signed up for Halo 4 at Plantronics ACL Brisbane, players had to fight their way through Pool Play to secure the seeds moving into the Double Elimination Bracket. Going into the event AVANT.GARDE, Elevate, Noxious Gaming and Full Force had proven themselves in Online Rounds being awarded Pro Status which automatically seeded these teams 1st-4th based on their Season 1 Points.<br />
<br />
After the battle of Pool Play was all said and done Aura eSports and Pure both tied at the top of the pool with 9 wins and 3 losses. Another Dimension came in at a close 3rd with 7 wins and 5 losses while Domesquad came in 4th place with 5 wins and 7 losses. SuperBestFriends came in last place with a 0-12 record.<br />
<br />
Aura and Pure had to play a tiebreaker so determine who would grab the 5th seed moving into the Double Elimination Bracket. This tiebreaker game was a single game of Team Slayer Haven and after what was an intense matchup Pure narrowly edged out Aura with a final score of 50-49. <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Seeds going into the Double Elimination Bracket:</strong><br />
<br />
1.	AVANT.GARDE<br />
2.	Elevate<br />
3.	Noxious Gaming<br />
4.	Full Force<br />
5.	Pure<br />
6.	Aura eSports<br />

<br />
Winners Bracket Round 1 of the Double Elimination Bracket was pretty tame, with the majority of matches being pretty one-sided. The biggest surprise of the round was Pure upsetting the 4th seeded pro team, Full Force, with a convincing 3-0 victory.<br />
<br />
The Winners Bracket Semi-Finals were very one sided as well. Noxious Gaming, our Online Round 2 champions, sent Elevate to the Losers Bracket in a clean sweep 3-0 with AVANT knocking Pure back down to earth 3-0.  In the Winners Bracket Finals the battle of the titans commenced as Noxious defeated the Number 1 seeded, Avant, 3-1 to advance into their second Grand Final in two consecutive tournaments.<br />
<br />
Losers Bracket Round 1 was very quick for both Aura and Full Force. Both teams took down their respective opponents 3-0. Losers Bracket Round 2 saw the number 2 seed, Elevate, face the Number 4 seed, Full Force. Elevate had no trouble knocking Full Force out of the competition with a very convincing 3-0. Pure and Aura met again after their epic tiebreaker to take out Pool Play. This time Pure didn’t bring their ‘A’ game with Aura taking the match from them 3-1.<br />
<br />
The Losers Bracket Semi-Final had Elevate take on Aura. Aura were looking strong after taking game 1 but that was where they fell short. Their momentum was shut out and they unfortunately went down 3-1 as Elevate booked a spot in the Losers Bracket Final where they would face AVANT.<br />
<br />
The Losers Bracket Final saw AVANT and Elevate go head to head for their spot against Noxious in the Plantronics ACL Brisbane Halo 4 Grand Final. AVANT came in as the Number 1 seed and proved they deserved that spot as they took out the match 3-1. This was the end of the road for Elevate who finished off with a respectable 3rd place.<br />
<br />
The Grand Final was the best match of the weekend. AVANT and Noxious were going heat to head once again bringing this series to a Best of 11. Noxious were confident after defeating AVANT 3-1 in their match up earlier in the bracket. This gave them the advantage as this score transferred over to the Best of 11 series. Noxious had no problem taking the first 2 games from AVANT bringing the series to 5-1. AVANT decided now was the time to up their game and they fought back with all their might, as displayed by winning the next 2 matches comfortably bringing the series back to 5-3. In game 9 of the series we had Team Slayer on Shutout, a traditionally slow map allowed for an epic match up. Noxious fought it out and managed to pull through taking out the 1st place spot after beating AVANT 50-47 and taking the series 6-3.<br />
<br />
A huge congratulation is in order for Noxious Gaming, the Plantronics ACL Brisbane Halo 4 Champions! AVANT.GARDE and Elevate also deserve a pat on the back for their 2nd and 3rd place finishes. <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Below are the final results of the tournament:</strong><br />
<br />
1.	Noxious Gaming<br />

<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'><span class='bbc_underline'>Tournament Structure:</span></span></strong><br />
This tournament will host a typical One Day Competition format featuring a straight up Double Elimination bracket. This means no pool play will be played for this tournament and all seeding for the Double Elimination bracket will be based off ACL Season 1 points. Each registered teams will have their individual players total points added up to a team total, which will be the points used to seed the bracket. All teams without season points will be seeded randomly after all teams that do have points, so the more points you have the better position you will have in the bracket. Please be aware that even though this tournament is seeded by ACL Season 1 points, Season 2 is its own individual Season and points will not carry over from Season 1 to Season 2. So if you were behind in Season 1, don't worry, Season 2 is your chance to catch up!<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'><span class='bbc_underline'>Ruleset & Gametypes:</span></span></strong><br />
The ruleset and gametypes that will be used for this tournament will be the official MLG Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 ruleset. Our rules will be updated to reflect this over the following days.<br />

		<title>ACL 2013 Further Details Released!</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-2013-further-details-released-r237</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i50.tinypic.com/dw9mw1.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='color: #FFA500'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>ACL 2013 Further Details Released!</span></strong></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>ACL is pleased to release further details of its 2013 circuit, with a live webcast to follow early in the new year on the topic. 2013 will see some revolutionary changes to ACL’s year-long event structures, unlike any ACL circuit before.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
The Australian Cyber League has always been committed to providing the biggest, most exciting and most professional gaming circuit in Australia. Since 2006, we've been on a never-ending learning curve, finding out what the Australian gaming community wants and striving to deliver it.<br />
<br />
2013 will bring with it some necessary changes to the ACL circuit. Some of these changes have already been outlined in the 2013 circuit teaser. If you missed the teaser, ACL’s season structure is undergoing revolutionary change, moving away from an annual year-long circuit, to being broken down into 3 distinct seasons for 2013.<br />
<br />
The ACL 2013 circuit will also bring renewed focus to online events, making them more important than ever. <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>STRUCTURE OVERVIEW - ACL Seasons</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
ACL will have 3 distinct seasons in 2013, each season being 8-12 weeks in length. This structure gives ACL the ability to add or remove aspects of the circuit, even supported titles, without having the downside of having to wait an entire year. This will also give gamers the chance to be crowned champions without penalising them for not attending every event of the year. That said, there will still incentives to attend as many events as possible.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>HOW IT WILL WORK - Season Structure</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Each of the 3 seasons will consist of an online competition (2 for Season 1) and a LIVE event. The online competition, whilst a tournament in itself, will also decide seeding for the season’s upcoming LIVE event. Points will reset each Season, however, a yearly background points system will be in place seeding the finals event.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>LAN Event Structure – First 2 Seasons</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Team Games</strong>: The Top 4 placing teams from the online competition seed straight into the Top 4 positions in the live event bracket. These teams are classified as the Pro Teams for that season. The remaining spots in the bracket will then be fought for at the event.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Individuals</strong>: Similar to Team Games structure but with a higher number of Pro Players. This structure is being refined with SC2 Admins whilst taking the launch of Heart of the Swarm into consideration.<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>LAN Event Structure – Finals</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Yearly season points will seed the Top 4 teams for 4v4 titles and Top 8 players from 1v1 titles straight into the invite online final event. One or more online tournaments will seed additional teams and players invited to the final event.<br />
<br />
8 teams will be invited for 4v4 titles and 16 players for 1v1 titles.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>LAN Event Schedule:</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<em class='bbc'>Note: Although these are likely, please do not book any accommodation/airfares until the official announcement. These dates and locations are subject to change.</em><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>April – Brisbane<br />
July – Melbourne<br />
September/October – Sydney – NATIONAL FINALS</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Confirmed Titles:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Titles are still to be confirmed. We can however confirm that Starcraft 2, Halo 4 and CoD Black Ops 2 will be in Season 1 with the possibility of more titles being added.<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Words from the Director</strong></span>:</span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #A0522D'>Gamers, it is with great pleasure that we unveil some of our plans for 2013. Since meeting at our summit, where ACL's top organisers sat down to strategise 2013, we have set a very clear direction for where we want to go this year. I had hoped we would be able to provide you with some more detailed information on next year's event schedule and game lineup. Unfortunately due to the enormity of our vision, we are still in a heavy negotiating and planning phase at this time. While we work out the finer details with vendors, sponsors and venues, take this information as a guide for how we see the year taking shape. There will definitely be some much bigger announcements in the future that includes some of the points I mentioned earlier, and even beyond that, but for the meantime please take this for what it is - an outline to 2013 for ACL.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience and I look forward to what looks to be an incredible year!<br />
<br />
Vanz</span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>ACL is at the forefront of Australian eSports and is more dedicated than ever to bringing Australian gamers a fun, exciting and competitive format to play and compete in their favorite games. 2013 will bring with it new and exciting changes and as ACL grows and develops, we will continue to support the community to the best of our ability. Here's to ACL 2013!</strong></span></span>]]></description>

<span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 17px;'>ACL Brisbane After Party!</span></span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>For the first time ever ACL are putting on an Official After Party! <br />
After what will be a glorious weekend of gaming we wanted to give you a way to relax and see the weekend off.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
The ACL Brisbane After Party will start up as the weekends event comes to a close. It's going to be a great environment to relax and spend some time with the people you know so well online. We are particularly keen as ACL Staff to shake off the wekeend's workload and enjoy a beverage with you all. We encourage you to take the time to talk with us about the event, feedback and the future of competitive gaming!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>What:</span></strong></span><br />
There will be a cash bar open to those who are invited to the ACL Brisbane After Party (shown in the 'Who' section below). This will be a fantastic celebration of the event that just occurred, in a location only metres away from the venue.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>How It Will Work:</span></strong></span><br />
<em class='bbc'>Stage 1:</em><br />
Pro Players will be invited to join the festivities as soon as the event is wrapped up (sorry - no +1s at this stage).<br />
<em class='bbc'>Stage 2:</em><br />
Everyone else is encouraged to help make packup a smooth and swift experience, putting their bit in to help ACL. Once the event is completely packed up (or close to it), the After Party will be opened up to those other players or spectators.<br />
<br />
Packup can be a very easy (or very painful) experience for ACL's volunteers and this is usually dependant on the number of helpers we have. In the past, only a handful of people have stayed back to help. Together, as a SUPER UNIT, we can smash packup in possibly as short as 45 minutes. Please do what you can to help us in this regard so we can party with you!<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Date/Time:</span></strong></span><br />
Sunday the 14th of April from event close (approx. 7-8pm) until 12 midnight.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Who:</span></strong></span><br />
*18+ only with legal identification - sorry younger folks!*<br />
ACL Pro Players with a Pro Zone Pass <br />
Volunteers (after pack up is completed)<br />
Spectators with a wristband (after pack up is completed)<br />
ACL Staff<br />
<br />
**As this is a fantastic event with high demand, we will need to monitor WHO is coming into the area carefully. You will need your wristband from the event in order to get in. Do NOT throw this out prematurely <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />**<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Where:</span></strong></span><br />

We will guide you to the appropriate room on completion of the event.<br />

<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'><span class='bbc_underline'>Tournament Structure:</span></span></strong><br />
The Gears of War Judgment Free For All Tournaments are for individuals looking to test their skills against others in a chaotic battle where every man plays for themselves. A typical round will pit 8 players against each other at once on designated FFA maps.<br />
Each game has a 25 kill limit.<br />
Progression to the next round is not based on a set number. Because attendees at each tournament differ greatly, a formula that means ‘top 4 progress’ is not always applicable. While this rule is followed where possible, there are often some advancements for odd numbers based on these statistics:<br />
Place &gt; Kills &gt; K/D &gt; Assists &gt; Deaths.<br />
That means, in some instances, players who place 5th or less may still progress based on those statistics in comparison to players in the same position in other pools. Ie:If 2 extra spots are available for progression for 5th placers, ACL will look at who had more kills first.<br />
<br />
The Two Tier Structure:<br />
Round 1 – Will determine Tier A and Tier B Bracket:<br />
Tier A<br />
Tier B<br />
All players start in Tier A FFA Round 1. From there players who place Top 4 in FFA Round 1 will continue their progression through the Tier A bracket. Players who place below Top 4 in FFA Round 1 will progress through the Tier B Bracket.<br />
Tier A: Tier A is made up of the top 4 placing players from each FFA Round and the bracket will progress all the way to the Tier A Finals. If you place outside the top 4 in a FFA Round (unless its Tier A FFA Round 1) then you are knocked out of the FFA Tournament.<br />
Tier B: Tier B is made up of the players who placed below top 4 in Tier A FFA Round 1. Tier B works exactly the same as Tier A, players progress through the Tier B bracket by placing in the top 4 in their Rounds, and if they place below Top 4 then you are knocked out of the FFA Tournament.<br />

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>For the first time ever at an ACL national event, we are looking to reward the pro players that put the most time and energy into our competitions. By providing specialist Pro Zone areas at our Plantronics ACL event this April 13th and 14th in Brisbane, those elite players will receive a few extra perks that should help them to relax and focus on their game. This is just a part of what ACL is trying to accomplish in recognising the heroes of our games and rewarding our most loyal followers.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
ACL has long been trying to raise the profile of our Pro Players, at the same time giving our newer players something to strive to achieve. We watch our foreign counterparts celebrate in the efforts their pro players put in and we believe the least we can do is to give some level of status and perks to those that work hard to achieve results in our competitions. In a similar vein, don't forget that the last event of this year for ACL is an invite only event, focusing on the spectator experience and the final battle of our professional players for the crown of 2013 champions. Let's now take a look at some further details of the Plantronics ACL Brisbane Pro Zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>What do they get?</strong></span><br />
So what does this mean for our Pro Players? What perks are on offer?<br />
<br />
- Exclusive Pro Zone competition areas: separate, roped off area of play<br />
- Exclusive Pro Zone breakout room: A quiet retreat for Pro Players to take a breath, regroup and focus. Each Player is allowed a +1 to gain entry to the breakout room with them also.<br />
- Exclusive Early Access to the official ACL After Party (to be announced separately soon)<br />
- Free energy drinks or bottled water<br />
- Internet access to post/comment and update their fans via social media in the Pro Zone break room<br />
- A Pro Pass for the Pro Zone to keep (as shown below) that allows Pros access to the exclusive areas<br />

		<title>ACL Halo 4 Online Round 2 Wrap Up</title>

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is in full swing as we come closer to the first National Event, Plantronics ACL Brisbane. ACL Halo 4 Online Round 2 hosted this past weekend went off with a bang and showcased an incredible weekend of Halo boasting some of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand.</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
Season and Yearly points were up for the taking so teams had a lot riding on their performance and the result of this weekend. The Australian Cyber League’s second official Halo 4 Online Round was played over the weekend of March 23rd and 24th and we saw some hot talent this weekend with the likes of Avant, Came Saw Conquered, Elevate, Menace to Society and Noxious showing up for the event.<br />
<br />
With 25 teams signed up players had to fight their way through Pool Play on Saturday to secure their spot in the Double Elimination Bracket. Only 16 teams could go through so 9 teams would see their competition finished by the end of Saturday. The Double Elimination Bracket came through on Sunday delivering a great playing field for the 16 successful teams who made it through Pool Play. With an incredibly diverse set of teams and great matchups throughout the weekend we were in for some great Halo.<br />
<br />
Saturday saw teams separated into 4 pools. The top 12 teams would successfully move through to the Double Elimination Bracket on Sunday where they would meet the top 4 seeded teams Pro teams, based on their Season 1 points.<br />
<br />
Aura eSports dominated Pool A without dropping a game, coming through with a 4-0 win ratio. New Era came in at second narrowly missing out on a top finish after losing 1-2 vs. Aura and Full Force came in at 3rd.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Royal D and No Hope were fighting it out in Pool B, with No Hope missing out on the top spot despite beating The Royal D 2-1. Impact came in at 3rd after a few close games across the pool.<br />

<br />
Noxious Gaming took Pool C without dropping a round in an excellent performance. Classified and Shredded were battling it out for the 3rd spot with Classified squeezing past Shredded by defeating them 2-1. RareForm cleaned up where Noxious left off winning their remaining 3 matches 3-0.<br />

<br />
Pool D had a larger pool than the rest, giving teams a bit more of a warm up for the weekend’s events. Judgement, ARISE and Conspiracy Theory had a great day of games taking control of the pool early on. Conspiracy Theory had a few close games which resulted in their 3rd place finish. Judgement were overly dominant only losing rounds to the other teams in the top 3.<br />

<br />
Meeting these 12 teams in the Double Elimination Bracket were the top 4 seeds:<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>1</strong> Avant<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2</strong> Came Saw Conquered<br />
<strong class='bbc'>3</strong> Elevate<br />
<strong class='bbc'>4</strong> Menace to Society<br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 1 of the Double Elimination Bracket was pretty tame, with the majority of matches being pretty one-sided. ARISE and Aura kept things interesting by taking their match to the final map. ARISE pulled through and advanced to the next round.<br />
<br />
Round 2 saw a lot more excitement. Avant, the number 1 seed, were taken out 3-2 by The Royal D and would have to fight their way through the Losers Bracket. Noxious Gaming also took out a top seeded team, Menace to Society, in another closer 3-2 match up. ARISE and Judgment both had a pretty easy time taking out their matches 3-0 and 3-1 respectively.<br />
<br />
The Winners Bracket Semi-Finals were very one sided, Noxious Gaming moving past Royal D 3-1 and Judgement knocking ARISE down to the Losers Bracket 3-0. In the Winners Bracket Finals Noxious showed they weren't slowing down for any team ultimately defeating Judgement 3-1 to secure their place in the Grand Finals.<br />
<br />
Now to the Losers Bracket. The Losers Bracket was extremely quick and one sided moving from LBR1 through to LBR4. Every match was either a 3-0 or a 3-1 win for the successful teams. <br />
It wasn't until LBR5 that we saw any heated matches and some teams out for revenge. Avant and The Royal D were back up against each other, Avant with everything to prove after being knocked to the Losers Bracket by Royal D. Coming into the matchup Royal D were ahead 3-2 however Avant managed to pull back into the series and ultimately took 4 games straight, pushing Royal D out of the tournament with a respectable 4th place finish.<br />
<br />
The Losers Bracket Final saw Avant and Judgement go head to head, both teams needing this win to advance to the Grand Final to face Noxious. Avant came in with the momentum off their previous win and proved to be too much for Judgement who unfortunately didn't get a single map on Avant. Avant moved forward to the Grand Final and Judgement were finished for the weekend with a 3rd place placement.<br />
<br />
The Grand Final was the best match of the weekend, two excellent teams going head to head to secure crucial Season Points for their win. Noxious were on top of the world going into the Grand Final without dropping a match but Avant were still thriving off of their momentum and took the first match up 3-2. As Noxious went into the Grand Final through the Winners Bracket Avant needed to beat them in two best of five series to walk away the winners, so with Avant taking the first best of five series it was do or die time for Noxious. Noxious fought back in the second best of five series and showed Avant what they were really made of by punishing AVANT 3-0, proving to everyone they were here to stay and that they deserved the crown for ACL Halo 4 Online Round 2 - Season 1.<br />
<br />
Big congratulations are in order for Noxious Gaming, who not only won the tournament but also did it coming from Pool Play and taking down the number one seed on their way to victory. Congratulations also to Avant and Judgement on their 2nd and 3rd place finishes. Below is the top 16 final placing’s of the tournament.<br />

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is in full swing as we come closer to the first National Event, Plantronics ACL Brisbane. This past Saturday we played host to the second official Call of Duty Online Round of 2013; ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 2. We saw an impressive talent pool of 35 teams from across Australia and New Zealand battle it out in the hopes of claiming the top spot as their own. </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
Up for grabs were valuable Season and Yearly points giving teams plenty to fight for and plenty to prove. The competition fielded the best names in Australia and New Zealand Call of Duty including the likes of Avant, Mindfreak, Winning Formula, Noxious and the recent National CoD Championship winners, Team Immunity.<br />
<br />
This tournament hosted no Pool Play so teams jumped straight into a Double Elimination Bracket with seeds awarded from ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 1. With teams changing members and new teams signing up this allowed for quite a diverse range of teams at a range of seeds, in turn this created a wonderful lineup of matches which saw the tournament go off throughout the day.<br />
<br />
Notable match ups from Round 1/Round 2 would include Team Emperor vs Defy, where Emperor would walk away after a nail-biting 3-2 series and Plague vs Team Legacy, where Team Legacy were just edged out 3-2 by Plague. The highlight match from Winners Bracket Round 2 however would have to be Cert4 vs Noxious where Cert4 were down in the series 2-0 and managed to claw their way back to a 3-2 finish. Most other matches in Round 1/Round 2 had a pretty standard 3-0/3-1 result.<br />
<br />

<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 9px;'>Cert4 show they were not willing to give up when being 2-0 down</span></em></span></strong><br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 3 almost saw a 100% clean sweep with 7/8 teams advancing through winning their respective matches 3-0. NtenZity were the only team to put a round on their opponent, Mindfreak but it still wasn't enough for them to progress through to Winners Bracket Round 4.<br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 4 saw Immunity continue their dominance dismissing Carrion in a 3-0 fashion while the up and coming Winning Formula punishing Mindfreak 3-0 also. Team NOCHANCE cleaned up Cert4 3-1 and Avant narrowly pushing Myth eSports to the Losers bracket with a 3-2 win.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.com/v/0QmAUN6QNMU&hd=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://youtube.com/v/0QmAUN6QNMU&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="640" height="390"></embed></object></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 9px;'><em class='bbc'>Immunity not slowing down for Carrion</em></span></span></strong><br />
<br />
Up next we had Winners Round 5, or the Winners Bracket Semi-Finals. Winning Formula were riding on the back of their previous 3-0 win and didn't want to give NOCHANCE the thrill of a close match. Winning Formula smashed NOCHANCE into the Losers Bracket 3-0. Team Immunity arrived against Avant who came into the series wanting to end Immunity's win streak. Avant put up a tremendous 2 rounds giving Immunity the sweats but it wasn't enough to push Immunity to the losers bracket. Immunity walked away with a 3-2 win giving them a spot in the Winners Bracket Finals.<br />
<br />
With Team Immunity and Winning Formula in the Winners Bracket Final both teams were fighting for their spot in the Grand Final. Immunity wiped the sweat from their previous match, installed their dehumidifiers and gave Winning Formula a slaying. Taking the Winners Bracket Final 3-0, Immunity secured their spot in the Grand Final.<br />
<br />
Down to the final stages of the Losers Bracket, Losers Bracket Round 6 was Mindfreak saying goodbye to Cert4 by knocking them out the tournament with a 3-1 result and Carrion surprising a lot of on-lookers and probably Myth as well by taking down Myth 3-1, showing what Carrion are cable when on fire. In Losers Bracket round 7 Avant got revenge on the team that stopped them heading over to LA for the CoD Championship finals by giving Mindfreak a swift 3-0, handing Mindfreak their 6th place finish.<br />
<br />

<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 9px;'>Avant get their revenge on Mindfreak</span></em></span></strong><br />
<br />
Up next in Losers Bracket Round 8 was one of the highlight series of the tournament between Avant and Carrion. After Carrion's dominate display against Myth they carried on that momentum to take Avant to a 5 game series, narrowly losing 3-2. All players in this series took turns stepping up and pulling off huge plays, none perhaps as much as Ray from Carrion, who showed off some mouse-like aim with his impressive shot. <br />
<br />

<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 9px;'><em class='bbc'>Carrion nearly pulling off a massive upset</em></span></span></strong><br />
<br />
The Losers Bracket Final saw Winning Formula go up against Avant for a chance to play Immunity in the Grand Finals. Both teams came out hot and on-fire as Avant took game one, however Winning Formula answered right back taking game two and then next two games after to take the series 3-1 which awarded Avant a respectable third place finish. With Winning Formula and Immunity being the only teams left out of 35 of Australia and New Zealand's best it was an incredible feat to get this far, however both teams had their eyes on that number 1 spot. After Immunity had to wait in the Grand Finals for the Losers Bracket to play out it was questionable if that wait would affect their performance. Whether it be the result of a cold Immunity or a strong Winning Formula we saw Winning Formula taking out Game 1 S&D Aftermath 6-4 in the Grand Finals, making the series score 3-1 to Immunity in a continuation series. Determined to show Winning Formula what Immunity was capable of Immunity answered back and answered back strong taking the next 3 games of the series HP Raid 250-147, HP Standoff 250-65 and S&D Meltdown 6-3 in a dominating fashion. So ended ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 2 - Season 1 and one of the largest Black Ops 2 tournaments Australia & New Zealand has seen yet. <br />

The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit will be broken down into 3 season, each season ending with a live National event. Our official Online Rounds will seed yourself and your team leading up to National LAN events, where points mean everything. Do you have what it takes to be ranked within the Top 4 leading up to our first National event in April? Here our Top 4 teams, the Professional Teams, will be treated to an exclusive 'Pro Zone' which will be entirely their own. In the Pro Zone teams will be able to practice and scrim against the other Pro teams, have access to showcase matches live streamed to everybody at home, and most importantly secure themselves the Top 4 spots in the Double Elimination bracket, meaning they will not have to participate in Pool Play and will have secured themselves the best possible position to take out the tournament. Keep in mind that Season 1, our current Season, will host two official Online Rounds, meaning the Top 4 teams ranked by Season points leading into the first National Event will be awarded Pro status, and gain access to all the benefits this title allows. So practice hard, and play your hearts out, because Online Rounds have never been more important!<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='color: #FF8C00'>Call of Duty Champion ANZ Online Qualifiers Tournament Thread</span></span></strong></span></span><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 9px;'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>This thread contains vital tournament information for both the Australian and New Zealand Online Qualifiers.</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>ABOUT</span></strong></span><br />
ACL Pro is proudly working with Activision to find two of the best teams across Australia and New Zealand to represent the region in the worldwide Call of Duty Championship in Los Angeles April 5-7th. Call of Duty: Black Ops II fans will be able to compete in a series of qualifying events on Xbox 360 with the ultimate chance to play against the best teams in the world for a prize pool of $1,000,000. Both Australian & New Zealand Call of Duty: Black Ops II fans will be able to enter the first online qualifier, with seven teams vying for a chance to attend the Australian and New Zealand Call of Duty Final, presented by Activision, Xbox, and EB Games. In addition, a New Zealand only qualifier will see an eighth and final team join other qualifiers, who all earn a trip to compete in Sydney. Due to ratings and event restrictions, all entrants must be aged 18 years or older through all components of the competition and have a valid passport (with six months validity) by the Australian & New Zealand Final in Sydney.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE</span></strong></span><br />
The COD Championship ANZ Online Qualifiers will host two stages of competition; Pool Play then progressing to a Double Elimination Bracket. Pool Play is on Saturday March 2nd, Double Elimination is on Sunday March 3rd.  Both stages of the tournament start at 12pm (AEDT for Australian Qualifiers, NZDT for New Zealand Qualifiers).<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play</strong><br />
Saturday March 2nd will host Pool Play, where all teams will be placed into pools of 4-6 teams and play against every team in their pool. After Pool Play is complete you will have gained a win/loss ratio based on your results against the teams you played in your pool. Once all Pool Play games are done the <strong class='bbc'>Top 16</strong> teams based on Win/Loss ratio will progress to the second stage of the competition, the Double Elimination bracket. Pools in Pool Play for the Australian Online Qualifier will be seeded by ACL Season 1 points and every Pool will have (as close to as possible) the same amount of points in total to create the fairest possible Pools. For the New Zealand Online Qualifier AvT’s most recent LAN event results will bear significance to those seedings. All Pool Play matches will be Best of 3, meaning you need to play <strong class='bbc'>all 3 games</strong>. If there are any ties for in Win/Loss ratio after Pool Play, a 1 game tie breaker must be played between the teams that are tied. If both teams opt not to play this tie breaker then the team with the highest ACL Season 1 points will be awarded the higher spot out of the two tied teams.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination Bracket</strong><br />
The Double Elimination Bracket will only see the <strong class='bbc'>Top 16</strong> teams compete, which unfortunately means any teams that did not earn themselves a top 16 spot be eliminated from the tournament. Seeding for the Double Elimination Bracket will be awarded from the results from Pool Play, ie the team with the best Win/Loss ratio will be seeded 1st in the Double Elimination Bracket. Double Elimination will be Best of 5, which means the first team to win 3 games will progress and you do not play all 5 games unless necessary. In Double Elimination if you lose once, you are knocked down to the Losers Bracket and if you lose again you are knocked out of the tournament. Once the Double Elimination bracket reaches the Top 8, Losers Bracket Round 3, placement matches are <strong class='bbc'>compulsory</strong>. The CoD Championship ANZ LAN Final in Sydney will be seeded off the Online Qualifier Double Elimination results and therefor placements matches must be played within the Top 8 placements. Keep in mind, only 7 teams from the Australian Online Qualifier will progress to the ANZ LAN Final, which unfortunately means the team that places 8th will not compete at the Final event. Also, in the New Zealand Online Qualifier only the winning team will progress to the ANZ LAN Final, unfortunately all other teams will not.<br />

Once you are done with one series you continue straight into your next one.

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL Starcraft 2 Online Round 1 - Season 1 Wrap Up!</strong></span></span></span></span><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 9px;'>Written by Baldie</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>ACL Starcraft 2 is back in action in 2013 having just seen the completion of the first of two online rounds for season 1. On Sunday 9th February, 74 players entered a double elimination bracket to fight through a total of 147 best of 3 sets. It was sure to be a great day of Starcraft 2 action.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Starcraft 2 will take a new shape in 2013 for ACL with the implementation of a pro players corner as well as various other point based incentives which were not available in 2012. Featuring some of the best players of Australia and New Zealand including arguably Australia's biggest talent in GAMECOM Nv mOOnGLaDe, along with New Zealand's superstar Frenetic Array Petraeus, earning those valuable ACL points was never going to be easy.<br />
<br />
The structure of the tournament saw every set be a best of 3, allowing players to have the best chance of showcasing their talent in each matchup. Seeding took place using data from 2012, with all future online rounds being seeded by season points in 2013. Although rewarding those who played in ACL events in 2012, for players such as Xeria Gaming KingKong who arrived in Australia late last year were forced to fight from the bottom of the seeded bracket.<br />
<br />
First and second round games saw many expected wins but also a number of upsets. Frenetic Array Iaguz went into the tournament seeded 4th, qualifying him for a second round birth. Evidently his first match of the day would be none other than KingKong. Going into the set to many as the underdog, Iaguz dropped the first map on Ohana unable to hold an infestor and roach timing. Moving into the second map on Entombed Valley Iaguz didn't falter showcasing some amazing triple pronged attacks and shredding through KingKong's forces. Daybreak would be the 3rd and final map and once again Iaguz was able to dictate the flow of the game denying expansions while defending his own knocking KingKong into the lower bracket and showing the community he was here for blood. Iaguz continued his run taking out Exile 5 Frustration 2-0 before succumbing to AVANT Pox 1-2. In the lower bracket we saw a rematch against KingKong where he once again was able to win 2-1 in another great set before being taken out of the tournament by Xeria Gaming Poker 1-2.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another big talking point was the set between GAMECOM Nv mOOnGLaDe and Immunity Light in the Round of 8 Winners Bracket. Neither player had dropped a single map leading up to their set and with Light being a reliable results producer for Protoss it was sure to be a set not to miss. A great first map was showcased on Daybreak with a maxed army fight between both players. Light pulled the trigger and went for an attack with a healthy unit composition and with some nice micro was able to take down the infestors and broodlords of mOOnGLaDe and eventually the game. Map 2 saw us move to Antiga Shipyard with Light looking to end the set swiftly with a 7 gate all-in. mOOnGLaDe with a quick response piled on the roaches and was able to narrowly hold off the attack and took the map. Third map not surprisingly was Cloud Kingdom as chosen by Light. Another great showcase of talent saw Light hit a nice timing as mOOnGLaDe's infestors hit the field and had too much muscle with a healthy immortal count. Eventually mOOnGLaDe was forced to tap out and was knocked into the lower bracket. mOOnGLaDe continued his run in the lower bracket before eventually being knocked out by Petraeus in the Lower Bracket Semi Finals.<br />
<br />

<br />
Auxiliary MegaFonzi was another head turner throughout the day taking out Kez 2-0, Iris MightyKiwi 2-0 and most surprisingly in many eyes Immunity Mafia 2-0. Without dropping a single set he was met by PiG in Winner Bracket Semis where he was defeated 0-2. PiG later tweeted:  "MegaFonzie is really, really good. new SEA protoss powerhouse to come from Hobart?" Knocked into the lower bracket he was met by mOOnGLaDe who ended his run with a 2-0 victory. There is no doubt we will see more of MegaFonzi in major South East Asian and ACL events. Definitely somebody to keep an eye on in 2013!<br />

<br />
With the day drawing to a close the field of 74 was reduced to just 3: Petraeus, PiG and Light. Light, having taken out PiG in the Winner Bracket Finals had already guaranteed himself a position in the final set. Having just taken out mOOnGLaDe 2-0, Petraeus was showing very strong signs of taking out the entire tournament. First map in this last ZvZ was Daybreak and with it a very aggressive game. PiG was the first to engage making a handful of zerglings and banelings off 2 base following up with a roach baneling all-in. Managing to break through Petraeus' defenses PiG was able to take the first map. Map two saw us move to Cloud Kingdom and the roles reversed it seemed. Petraeus opting for a 9 pool to apply some early aggression following up with a 2-base zergling baneling all-in. PiG without his own baneling nest was unable to defend and tapped out forcing a third and final game on Ohana. The third map proved to be one of the best ZvZ's of the day with plenty of back and forth action. PiG with his roach baneling against Petraeus with his Roach, Hydralisk and Infestor  composition clashed heads and with some clutch fungals on a clump of PiG's banelings they were unable to connect on the Hydralisks of Petraeus and PiG was forced to GG out.<br />

<br />
The grand finals were somewhat anticlimactic to what was a great tournament. Light was originally unable to continue playing into the final set so the win was given through walkover to Petraeus. There were talks of a rematch at a later date but that need not eventuate as Light was amazingly able to find enough time to play the set out. With clearance from VaNzR the finals were played out off stream where Light was able to reclaim his spot as 1st.<br />
 <br />
You can watch the rebroadcast of the entire tournament on our Twitch.tv page <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.twitch.tv/ACLProsc2' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>here</a></strong></span>, direct links <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.twitch.tv/aclprosc2/b/365783722' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>here</a></strong></span>.

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit has kicked off! This Sunday just gone played host to ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 1 - Season 1, our first official Call of Duty Online Round of 2013, which fielded an impressive talent pool of 35 teams. Coming into Black Ops 2 lots of teams and players are trying to claw their way to the top and this tournament proved to be a perfect testing ground to show which teams will shine in 2013. </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
With the opportunity for teams to gain valuable Season and Yearly points, the Australian Cyber League’s first Black Ops 2 Online Round event came to a thrilling conclusion last Sunday, February 10th. Featuring some of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand including the likes of Unite, Cruelty Incarnate, Seraphix Nexus, Ignition and Auxiliary the competition was set to be a fierce one.<br />
<br />
As there was no Pool Play and no seeds coming into this tournament, the competition would start with the Bracket being drawn randomly, with all future Online Rounds being seeded by Season points and previous tournament placements. With 35 teams registered, there was quite a variety of match ups in Round 1 and it made for some very interesting competition.<br />
<br />
Notable match ups from Round 1/Round 2 would include Aura eSports vs Pongsu, where auRa would walk away after a nail-biting 3-2 series and Initiate vs Doritos Crash Course Superstars, where DCCS's awesome name wasn't enough to stop them just being edged out 3-2 by Initiate. Teams such as Unite, Cruelty Incarnate, Seraphix Nexus, Auxiliary, Cert 4 in Durry Rollering and Myth all breezed past their initial opponents, not dropping a map.<br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 3 was full of some dominating victories and some heart breaking defeats. Influence, despite putting up a valiant fight, dropped down 3-2 to Cruelty Incarnate and NtenZity unfortunately didn't have what it takes on the day to beat Myth, also bowing into the losers bracket after losing 3-2. Outbreak, Serphix Nexus, Auxiliary, Aura, Cert 4 in Durry Rollering and Unite all smashed their way through Winners Bracket Round 3, winning 3-0 or 3-1 respectively.  <br />
<br />
Winners Round 4 saw Unite being the only team left in the tournament not to drop a game, taking down Myth with relative ease 3-0. Seraphix Nexus managed to edge out Auxiliary 3-2, Cert 4 in Durry Rollering took out Aura eSports 3-1 and Cruelty Incarnate showed off a 3-1 win over Outbreak.<br />
<br />
Up next we had Winners Round 5, or the Winners Bracket Semi-Finals. Unite came out strong once again making a statement and showing they are a force to be reckoned with, taking out Cert 4 in Durry Rollering 3-0. Cruelty Incarnate on the other hand suffered what was probably the most heart breaking loss of the tournament. After being 2-0 up over Seraphix Nexus, they unfortunately could not hold their composure and managed to let game by game slip past them, losing out Game 5 with a margin of 209 - 222 in Hardpoint. <br />
<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 9px;'>Full series of Cruelty Incarnate vs Serphix Nexus</span></strong></em></span></span><br />
<br />
With Unite and Seraphix Nexus left as the only two teams still standing in the Winners Bracket, they were forced to battle in the Winners Bracket Finals for a spot in the Grand Finals. Game 1 was Harpoint on Raid and saw both teams fighting for early control of the Hardpoints. Serpahix Nexus lead majority of the match till 189 points, where Unite with the help of Buzzin and his killstreaks took the lead and didn't let up taking out game 1 216-208. Game 2, Search and Destroy Express, was another hard fought and close match. With each team going practically going round for round, up until 4-4 where Unite managed to pull away 6-4. Game 3, Capture the Flag Standoff, saw Unite take the first half 2-1, also scoring another flag in the second half, to defeat Seraphix Nexus with a final score of 3-1. Unfortunately for Seraphix Nexus, this sent them to the Losers Bracket while Unite was sitting pretty in the Grand Finals.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.com/v/6ivw3FZnKug"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://youtube.com/v/6ivw3FZnKug" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="640" height="390"></embed></object></span><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 9px;'><em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>Winners Bracket Finals - Unite vs Seraphix Nexus</strong></em></span></span></span><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the Losers Bracket, many teams were struggling to find their feet. Ignition, after dropping down to the Losers Bracket from their first series, managed to have an incredible run past Cmen Hunters, ADAMANT, Obelisk and Outbreak, only dropping 1 game in that duration. It wasn't until Losers Bracket Round 6 where they were finally stopped by Auxiliary, being defeated 3-0. The other Losers Bracket Round 6 match up hosted a rematch between Aura and Pongsu, with Aura managing to knock out Pongsu with a score of 6-4 in a continuation series. <br />
<br />
Down to the final stages of the tournament now with only 6 teams left, it was make or break time for teams wishing to prove themselves. Cert 4 in Durry Rollering, despite their comical name, managed to take down the skilled Auxiliary squad 3-0, sending Auxiliary home with a 6th place finish. Cruelty Incarnate, bouncing back from their rough defeat against Seraphix Nexus, showed they still had signs of life handing Aura their 5th place finishing, defeating Aura 3-1. From these two victors, only one would progress to play Seraphix Nexus in the Losers Bracket Final, and that would be Cert 4 in Durry Rollering, knocking out Cruelty Incarnate from the tournament and handing them a respectable 4th place finish.<br />
<br />
And then there were three! It was Losers Bracket Final time and we saw a fierce Seraphix Nexus squad, coming off a rough loss against Unite, going up against Cert 4 in Durry Rollering who were pulling off upset after upset in every round. Game 1, Hardpoint Slums, went 250-186 in Cert 4's favour. Game 2, Search and Destory Cargo, went down to the wire. Tied 5-5, each team traded player for player until it was only Fate and Genji left, with Fate managing to secure the last kill of the round and game on Genji, and get the defuse to win the match. Game 3, Capture the Flag Standoff, saw Seraphix Nexus run away with the match 6-0 and secure themselves a spot in the Final against Unite. Cert 4, although defeated by Seraphix Nexus, earned a prestigious 3rd place.<br />
<br />
Grand Final time! Well this one ended a bit differently then we'd like our tournaments to end. Both teams came out fighting in Game 4 in a continuation series in the Final. Unite showed their form had not be altered by the waiting time, going up 4-0 in the finals after winning Hardpoint Standoff 250-166. Game 5 however, showed Unite being handed their first loss of the tournament, being defeated by Seraphix Nexus 6-4 in Search and Destory Raid. However the next match, Capture the Flag Express, would happen to be the last match of the Finals and the tournament as Beastn, from Seraphix Nexus, unfortunately had to leave.

<br />
ACL has recently announced changes in our Pro Circuit structure, including the introduction of Seasons. The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit will be broken down into 3 season, each season ending with a live National event. Our official Online Rounds will seed yourself and your team leading up to National LAN events, where points mean everything. Do you have what it takes to be ranked within the Top 4 leading up to our first National event in April? Here our Top 4 teams, the Professional Teams, will be treated to an exclusive 'Pro Zone' which will be entirely their own. In the Pro Zone teams will be able to practice and scrim against the other Pro teams, have access to showcase matches live streamed to everybody at home, and most importantly secure themselves the Top 4 spots in the Double Elimination bracket, meaning they will not have to participate in Pool Play and will have secured themselves the best possible position to take out the tournament. Keep in mind that Season 1, our current Season, will host two official Online Rounds, meaning the Top 4 teams ranked by Season points leading into the first National Event will be awarded Pro status, and gain access to all the benefits this title allows. So practice hard, and play your hearts out, because Online Rounds have never been more important!<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'><span class='bbc_underline'>Details:</span></span></strong><br />

After Season 1 Online Round 1 & Online Round 2 have been completed, Season points will be added up and used to seed teams at the first live National event in April.

<br />
The Australian Cyber League has always been committed to providing the biggest, most exciting and most professional gaming circuit in Australia. Since 2006, we've been on a never-ending learning curve, finding out what the Australian gaming community wants and striving to deliver it.<br />
<br />
2013 will bring with it some necessary changes to the ACL circuit. The majority of these changes will be outlined in the ACL 2013 Full Announcement, to be released Monday 10th December. This announcement will be followed by an episode of ACL's In The Zone Webcast on Tuesday, 11th December. This show will feature a Q&A with ACL's CEO Nick Vanzetti, where he'll be taking questions from the community.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>The Changes:</strong><br />
Until then, ACL would like to provide you with some preliminary plans for 2013. ACL's season structure will undergo some revolutionary changes from its current formats. In the past ACL has held fast to an annual 'year long' season. For the first time ever, we are restructuring the points and season structure to include 4 distinct seasons in 2013. The first season will start in December and be online only, with the first LAN event scheduled for later in the year. <br />

		<title>ACL Halo 4 ODC Wrap Up!</title>

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>ACL’s online events have always been relatively popular, however, last weekend’s Halo 4 tournament smashed any previous ACL tournament participant numbers with a record-breaking 70 teams competing, consisting of new recruits and household names alike. Halo 4 is going to be huge in 2013 and this is only the beginning….</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
With the purpose of testing settings and competition structure for ACL’s 2013 season , the Australian Cyber League’s first ever Halo 4 online event came to a thrilling conclusion last Saturday, December 1st. Featuring some of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand including Mindfreak, NBT, Team Sidewinder and of course Infamous, the competition was set to be a fierce one.<br />
<br />
As there was no Pool Play or seeds of any kind, the competition would start with the drawing of the bracket via live stream on Friday night, where participants got their first look at their Round 1 opponents and how their journey through the bracket might look. With 70 teams registered, there was quite a variety of match ups in Round 1 and it made for some very interesting competition.<br />
<br />
Notable match ups from Round 1 would include Apex vs New Era, where Apex would walk away victorious taking the game 2-1 from New Era. Round 1 also saw the early defeat of Initial Concept, perhaps underestimating the team of Derpin Derps and their intimidating name. Other close match ups to mention would be Onslaught’s win over Four Sons of God, Prophecy’s win over Flair and Team Old School’s win over Suddoth’s Dad, all with series scores of 2-1.<br />
<br />
Winners Bracket Round 2 was full of dominating victories, with all winning teams doing so in a 2-0 fashion. Along with the big names, we also saw the likes of Forsaken, AHP, Exodus, Gander Squad and Road Kill all taking victories. Losers Bracket Round 1 would bring with it the first eliminations of the tournament, with honourable mentions going to Kitty Love, Final Four, Heroic Hoplites, RTFM, Quick Stix and Team Lunch Box among others.<br />
<br />
Winners Round 3 was yet another flawless round with all winners taking 2-0 victories. Infamous, Avant, Exodux, Derpin Derps, Team Sidewinder, Mindfreak, NBT and Spoon would all take wins while a couple of well-known names such as Apex, Counter Cap and RNR all fell to the Losers Bracket. Losers Bracket Round 2 also saw a clean sweep for the victors, all taking 2-0 wins, aside from Destiny who took one game off Cursed before unfortunately bowing out of the competition.<br />
<br />
Moving towards the finals, Winners Bracket Round 4 saw the big names snatch victory, however, there were also upsets to be had. One of the hot competition favourites, Mindfreak, were defeated by the Kiwi powerhouse Team Sidewinder, dropping them to the Losers Bracket. NBT also bit the dust against Spoon in another 3-0 series. The series of the round would have to be Infamous vs Avant, where Avant almost took the win but unfortunately were taken down 3-2. Down in the Losers Bracket, we said goodbye to RNR, AHP and Counter Cap.<br />
<br />

<span style='font-size: 13px;'><em class='bbc'>Pengzy's POV from the Infamous vs Avant series in WBR4</em></span></span><br />
<br />
Getting to the pointy end of the competition, the Winners Bracket Semi-Finals saw some amazing games of Halo 4 take place. Infamous took on Derpin Derps while Team Sidewinder was pitted against Spoon. Infamous took out a 3-1 victory over Derpin Derps and while they played valiantly, Spoon made quick work of the best New Zealand has to offer, Team Sidewinder. In the Losers Bracket we would see some amazing games with some big names being knocked out of the tournament, including Schnitty Snatchers, Exodus and Initial Concept. The series of the Round however, maybe even the tournament, would be that of Mindfreak vs NBT. NBT got the early lead on Mindfreak, winning the first two games. Not to be out-done, Mindfreak came back to win the next two, making the series score 2-2 and forcing the final game, Slayer on Haven. Towards the end of the game, Mindfreak were in front 47-40 before a stand-off occurred.  NBT were able to get control of the snipe and get a few kills, the resulting score after that battle was 48-47. Mindfreak then made a final push, being able to break through NBT and finish the game and series off with a nail-biting score of 50-48.<br />
<br />
The Winners Bracket Finals saw Infamous, the line-up of Roosters, iJayden, Fram and Pengzy, take on Spoon, consisting of Godlike, Silence, Lil Virus and Frosty. Despite the impressive line-up from Spoon, Infamous were able to continue their winning streak defeating Spoon 3-1 and advancing to the Grand Final. Down in the Losers Bracket, Avant took out Str8 Cordial before being knocked out of the tournament by Team Sidewinder in a 3-0 Fashion. Sidewinder were then to take on Mindfreak, who defeated Derpin Derps 3-1. The matchup of Team Sidewinder vs Mindfreak was much anticipated and despite both teams playing valiantly, Mindfreak would be the team to emerge victorious, defeating Sidewinder 3-1 giving them a respectable 4th place finish. The Losers Bracket Finals saw Mindfreak up against Spoon where yet again Mindfreak took the victory, eliminating Spoon 3-1.<br />

After winning the Losers Bracket Finals, Mindfreak would get their first shot at the as-yet undefeated Infamous squad. Although many thought that Mindfreak, with their renewed formation of Hopey, Blaze, Halvo and Pulse would win the competition, it would not be the case. Infamous shined in the Grand Final and continued their winning streak, defeating Mindfreak 3-1 and taking out ACL’s first ever Halo 4 competition!<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>1 year later, just before the release of Halo 4, but here it is!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Australian Cyber League and Vendetta Films proudly present the ACL Halo Reach Community Montage 2 edited by Backfire. This montage showcases some of the most amazing MLG clips the ACL community produced from the inception of Reach to late 2011.<br />

<br />
<strong class='bbc'>"This montage was never completely finished and all gameplay after 04:35 is unedited and very raw due to the fact the second half of the montage was still in progress. Due to laziness on my behalf and myself providing Backfire with no direction post October 2011 this montage has just sat unfinished for almost a year. I decided to release this unfinished version of the montage so everyone can see the amazing work Backfire did with our community's clips. Although it is a shame that the montage was unfinished and I apologise to Backfire for not pushing this project forward he still did an amazing job and I can't thank him enough for his work."</strong> - ACL Beware.]]></description>

		<title>Forza Launch Event – “May The Forza Be With You”</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/forza-launch-event-%e2%80%93-%e2%80%9cmay-the-forza-be-with-you%e2%80%9d-r230</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='font-size: 21px;'>Forza Launch Event – “May The Forza Be With You”</span></span></span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>In the midst of the latest and greatest cars from around the world at the 2012 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, were eight racing car seats in front of eight Xbox 360's and eight television screens, ready to show off the highly anticipated racing game from Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games, Forza Horizon. </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/this.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
On the line were not pink slips to a "fully sick" car or a set of new tools or anything else that would enthuse your average rev head. Instead, something more aimed towards a gamers heart - a brand new Xbox 360. A group of 16 gamers from around the nation all eagerly waiting for the chance to t ake home the bundle, all you had to do was be in the top 3 to qualify in the preliminary round and then take out the second race on top. Easy right?<br />
<br />
The first race got underway and it was chaotic. Cars were grinding against each other, and sharing pixel paint becoming all scratched up, bumpers and other random car parts went flying and someone even managed to flip their Lamborghini. However, the top few had managed to break away from the shenanigans and there was no stopping them. <br />
  <br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/3-4.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
When race two came along it was my time to shine in the second and final preliminary round. Having played Forza Horizon at the EB Expo some weeks earlier in addition to a few practice rounds before the event started, consecutively finishing in the top two I felt quietly confident. I knew how the car handled, I knew the danger spots in the track, I even knew some of my competition and their driving styles. But when that green light flashed, my confidence quickly turned to caution as I tried to steer clear of anyone else and make my way to the front with my exotic Italian unscathed.<br />
<br />
The plan worked. I had quickly made my way to front of the pack early on, and all I had to do was keep it that way. The first of the difficult corners approached. I knew when and where to brake and how to control the car into a nice drift around the corner. Everything was going well. Too well. I was half way around the corner, nailing it almost perfectly, and then BANG! I had turned from an elite racer into the braking assistance system for another driver. It was over as one after another my seven opponents passed me, presumably flipping the bird in their rear view mirrors. I was in last place. My dreams of a shiny new Xbox had quickly come to an end and as much as I tried to claw my way back to the top, I had lost all concentration and forgot everything about the tricky track, the feel of the car and was instead just trying to be as fast as possible to play catch up. I ended up crawling my way to fifth position but couldn't get anywhere near the leaders.  <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/4-5.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
 <br />
Then it was all down to this, the finals! The top drivers from the two previous races were going head to head, this time it was on. There was a bit of rivalry between those who knew each other, and once again the paint went flying. But this forced these drivers to the back of the pack, a lesson learned the hard way. Professional race car driver and lovely Sarah Harley commentated the races, giving her tips and critiques to the drivers along the way. The race was over in just over four minutes, and the winner Rory, was accompanied by the stunning Forza Horizon "booth babes" and was awarded his winners trophy from Sarah and went home with a brand new Xbox 360. This is how games should be promoted.<br />
<br />
Now let's talk about the game itself. It's a risky maneuver from the team at long-term Forza developers Turn 10 and new guys Playground Games, bringing the tight racing mechanics we've learnt to expect from the Forza series, however adding an open world element often seen in the Need For Speed franchise. It seems to even take a similarly bright and bold coloured menu system from Dirt 2. <br />
<br />
As you'd expect the driving mechanics are once again phenomenal, you can even notice minor differences in the cars performance and handling whether it is tuned correctly or not. Another change from the regular tarmac based tracks seen in the previous Forza games, Forza Horizon offers wide variety of roads and includes races that combine normal tarmac as well as slippery dirt roads, and this can take a while to get used to. It's instantly noticeable from driving on the grip of tarmac to the slip and slide conditions of a dirt road where you need to learn to feather the accelerator to keep your ideal driving line in check. You’ll also find that it will take some time to adjust and get the transition between the two perfectly. Also, let it be known that there is a reason that we don't see people driving Lamborghinis on dirt roads. It's near impossible to stay straight and it’s terrible for the paintwork.<br />
<br />
Single player has some sort of story involved all about getting to the top of the Horizon Festival, and for a racing game, the characters and voice acting actually seem half decent and also has you racing in a variety of different challenges, including against a hot air balloon. The game feels as though it's aimed at the more casual racer at times, allowing users to automatically tune cars just to fit the requirements and offers a huge variety of visual adjustments. However, it still keeps the same in-depth tuning flexibility that will keep Forza enthusiasts and car fanatics happy. <br />
<br />
 Visually, Forza Horizon is simply stunning, the high attention to detail of all the cars to the gorgeous landscape of Colorado. As always they have nailed the look of each and every car in the lineup paying homage to the skilled people that design these four wheeled monsters. It even has a wonderful "Google Satellite" like map to navigate your way around the in-game world. <br />
<br />
Another nice addition is the environment, being an open world game you have a chance to explore as much as you wish and the Turn 10 and Playground Games teams have chosen a fantastic location in Colorado. Providing a wide variety of different roads and environments from tight inner city streets, to driving around the Rocky's with nothing holding you back other than a small barricade between you and the edge of a cliff. Being an open world, another feature that the team is proud of is the weather and daylight/night engine. You will find yourself just wanting to free roam around the world to see some of the scenes that occur throughout this Colorado environment. <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/5-4.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span> <br />
<br />
Sound has a major influence in bringing this game to life. All the cars sound very different, unique and are extremely authentic, but this time Forza has included some commercial music into the game, which to me, plays a big role in the enjoyment of a racing game and is a welcome change from the repetitive and boring beats heard in Forza 4. There are three different radio stations Horizon Bass, Horizon Pulse and Horizon Rocks with songs from Avicii, Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys and hopefully this will suit everyone’s music tastes. <br />
<br />
One thing I didn't enjoy was the constant amount of advertising in-game that is constantly shoved in your face. While I can understand that it's meant to be a festival event, and a festival has sponsors, it often feels like I'm playing through an interactive commercial. However, since playing Forza Horizon I have had strange cravings for a Rockstar Energy Drink.<br />
<br />
While we were only playing Forza Horizon for a small period of time, the amount of achievements we received was crazy. Depending your view of achievements, this can be a good or bad thing. Although, I did enjoy some of the titles/pop culture references of these achievements such as "#WINNING!",  "A Wristed Development" and my personal favourite "May the Forza Be With You". <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/6-4.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span> <br />
<br />
Overall, Forza Horizon is an absolutely beautiful game, having moved away from the traditional Forza format and adding elements seen in other racers while including some of their own new flair to the genre, and trying to find a place between a in-depth driving simulation experience and a casual racer. Will the risk of changing the format have pay off? Only time will tell. <br />
<br />
Forza Horizon is out in stores October 23rd 2012.]]></description>

Remember the days when American muscle was all about straight line speed and knock-you-back-in-your-seat acceleration? Those days have returned with the 2012 Dodge Challenger SRT8 392. With 470 horsepower and aggressive styling, the 2012 Dodge Challenger is beauty and brawn combined. Pre-order Forza Horizon today and you’ll receive a token for a free download of a Horizon-themed 2012 Dodge Challenger SRT8 392 in Forza Motorsport 4!<br />

<img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/5-2.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
A new Ferrari is always cause for celebration, and you can still hear the cheers from fans of the 458. Little wonder: the Prancing Pony went above and beyond the call with this gorgeous example of road-devouring art. The 458 produces 562 horsepower and a top speed over 200 mph, giving it the kind of performance you normally only see on the world’s greatest race tracks.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2010 Volkswagen Golf R</strong><br />
<img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/6-2.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
Available only in Europe, this could be the sportiest Golf to date. Two hundred and sixty seven horsepower from its 2.0-liter turbo make it a kick in the pants when pushed, and it can be pushed all the way up to a governor-mandated 155 mph. Twin central exhaust tips, L shaped LED taillights, and plenty of glossy black give the Golf R a look that matches its performance. <br />

<strong class='bbc'>2012 Aston Martin Virage</strong><br />
<img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/9.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
Plush luxury meets frightening performance in the 2012 Aston Martin Virage. Comfortable enough for a long Sunday drive, yet sporting a blistering 490 horsepower V12, the Virage continues Aston Martin’s legacy of creating cars that are much more than their elegant exteriors bely.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2010 Nissan 370Z</strong><br />
<img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/10.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
Once again, Nissan has delivered a car that can compete with models ten times its price. The 370Z features grippy handling and drift-worthy rear wheel drive, motivated by a 3.7-liter, V6 with more than enough juice to excite even the most die-hard of sports car enthusiasts. In short, the 370Z can do it all.<br />

<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Qualified Player Information:</span></strong></span><br />
Once a player or a team has qualified for an EB Expo E-Sports title they must inform their respected ACL Admin whether or not they plan to attend the event. Clarification of attendance MUST be given on the same day a player or team qualifies. If you are unsure at the time you will be given <span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>3</strong></span> days to get back to ACL Admins otherwise your spot will be offered to the next down placing team or player.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Placement Rounds:</span></strong></span><br />
As per the information above, it is <strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>EXTREMELY</span></strong> important placement rounds are played in all EB Expo E-Sports Qualifiers. If a player or team choses not to participate in placement rounds then they will forfeit their placement position to the lowest possible outcome.<br />

<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Structure:</span></strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play – Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. <br />
Each series MUST plan ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination – Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs earlier.  Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement rounds will determine the Overall Points for your placing.<br />
<br />
Double Elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all the tiebreakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed in the DE bracket to fight it out to for the top spot and the prizes that go alongside it.<br />
<br />

<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. This is dependent on registration numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF8C00'><span class='bbc_underline'>Structure:</span></span></strong><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. This is dependent on registration numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
<br />
Pool play gametypes will look like this - CTF, S&D, CTF.<br />
<br />
There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage. Teams will go head to head on Saturday in Pool Play to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on Sunday. <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16. If you do not show up to your Placement Rounds you forfeit your chance of earning the best possible result for your team. Double elimination will occur Sunday and be played out all day until a winner is found. <br />
<br />
Double elimination map rotation - CTF, S&D, CTF, S&D, CTF.<br />

Saturday marks the completion of the Australian Nationals which will crown this year’s best Australian StarCraft II players. Their chance to celebrate will be short lived though as the top six Australian players will clash with the top two New Zealand players in the Oceania Finals on Sunday. The two finalists coming out of the event will then go on to represent the region in the Battle.net World Championship in China later this year.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FFA500'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><strong class='bbc'>Blizzard World Championship Series Australia Nationals & Oceania Finals - Ticket Details!</strong></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'>Due to the high demand for the Blizzard WCS event and the extremely fast ticket sell out time we have made extra arrangements to try and accommodate those who missed out. Below outlines further ticket plans and information that both current ticket holders and people seeking tickets should be aware of.</span></span></strong><br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Ticket Confirmation:</span></strong></span><br />
On Wednesday 1st August all current ticket holders will receive a confirmation email that asks them to let event organisers know of their intent to still attend the event.  If ticket holders reply letting ACL know that they will no longer be attending the event then the tickets will become available again to the public. These tickets will then be re-released separately to 'giveaway tickets' and released in the exact same method as the original tickets using the 'first in, best dressed' method.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Giveaway Tickets:</span></strong></span><br />
ACL will hold a series of ticket giveaways this coming week from our Twitter and Facebook pages. These tickets will be given away in a number of different ways (trivia, random, first reply etc) so keep an eye out as they will go quick! It is unconfirmed how many 'giveaway' tickets we are allowed to offer at this point, but understand the number is very limited. If you are already a current ticket holder you are unable to win further tickets.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Blizzard WCS Barcraft - Hosted in conjunction with APL:</span></strong></span><br />
ACL and APL have organised a Barcraft event at the Paragon Hotel on Saturday August 11th to house the many fans of this great game and culture. Kudos to the APL guys getting involved and helping to keep this huge event accessible to all those who want to watch this even. ACL will be doing what it can to make sure this is a barcraft you don't want to miss !]]></description>

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'>ACL Regionals 3 - Blizzard World Championship Series Qualifiers!</span></span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The Australian Cyber League is proud to announce the details of our Starcraft 2 Regionals 3 dates. If you missed the announcement, you may be pleased to hear these events are also home to the Australian Blizzard World Series Qualifiers! If successful at one of these tournaments you will earn yourself a spot at National event held later in the year. Read below for all the details and how you can register yourself for one of these qualifiers!</strong></span></span><br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Blizzard World Series Qualifiers being ran in conjunction with ACL Regionals:</span></strong></span><br />
The Starcraft II World Championship Series consists of tournaments held in nearly every part of the world, bringing players from all over the globe together to compete for pride, glory and prizes.<br />
<br />
Starting with National Qualifiers, players will battle it out for a chance to prove they have what it takes to be the best in the country, and qualify for the Oceanic Finals in their part of the world. Then, the winners of the Oceanic Finals will earn a place to fight in the Starcraft World Championship Series, where they’ll compete for not only prizes, but the title of World Champion.<br />
<br />
The Australian Cyber League have been named the Primary Partner of the Australian stage of the Blizzard World Championship Series and as such our Regionals events and ACL Melbourne will be qualifiers for the Nationals event to be held later in the year. The Nationals event (details TBA) will host all the qualified players in a tournament with $6000 in prizes to be given away thanks to Blizzard. On top of that, the top 6 players from the Nationals will be invited to complete for $12000 in cash at the Oceania finals.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>ACL Season Structure:</span></strong></span><br />
For those new or unfamiliar to the Australian Cyber League, there are 3 components to our competitions and season, each awarding points for your performance in these events.<br />
<br />
- <span class='bbc_underline'>ACL Regionals:</span> As announced, an open invite to compete for season points in each city.<br />
<br />
- <span class='bbc_underline'>Online Events:</span> An open invite for all to compete online against players in Australia & NZ.<br />
<br />
- <span class='bbc_underline'>National Events:</span> 4 of these in 2012. The next to be shortly announced as ACL Melbourne. These have the biggest attendance & biggest prizes.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>How the circuit will work in brief:</span></strong></span><br />
You will earn points for every placing you receive within the top 32 at each event you compete in during 2012. Each component of the competition has a varying weighting of points distribution.<br />
<br />
The National events for Starcraft 2 are Invite Only for the Pro Bracket. Invitations will be sent out based on your season points and only the top 16 ranked players in Australia by season points will be invited to the most advantageous spot for the Tournament. All other competitors at National events must fight their way through the Open Bracket.<br />
<br />
Everyone in most capital cities will have 2 chances to accrue season points before the first national event. 1 x Live Qualifier (ACL Regionals event) and 1 x Online Round before each National event.<br />

		<title>Blizzard WCS Spectator Tickets Sold Out in 15 M...</title>

<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>Fans of Starcraft are left to gather themselves after the excitement of snatching up their spectator tickets for the Blizzard World Championship Series Australian Nationals and Oceania Finals.</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
A total of 600 spectator tickets, 300 each for Saturday and Sunday, were available for free as of 9am today from ACL’s website. Needless to say, the tickets were eagerly anticipated by fans of Starcraft from all around the country and it’s easy to see why.<br />
<br />
16 of Australia’s best Starcraft gamers including household names Moonglade, Pig and Mafia, as well as former Starcraft: Brood War Pro Legionnaire, will go head to head during the Australian Nationals on Friday and Saturday 10-11 August. At the conclusion of the Australian Nationals, the top 6 players will go through to meet the 2 of New Zealand’s finest gamers to face off in the Oceanic Finals.<br />
<br />
The Australian Nationals have a cool $10,000USD Prize Pool, so a lot is at stake. The 8 players who made it through to the Oceania Finals will then compete for their share of a whopping $15,000USD prize money on Sunday August 12. Not only does the winner get to roll in their share of the cash, but they also get their shot to take on the best in the world as they will qualify for the Blizzard World Championship Series Finals to be held in China later in the year.<br />
<br />
It’s shaping up to be quite an event, with not only Australia’s best players but also the World’s best casters and commentators in attendance. The “Casting Archon” Tastosis, arguably the world’s most renowned Starcraft casting duo, along with HD&PainUser, two of the USA’s greatest casters will be attending the event to help bring you the most entertaining and highest quality stream possible. The event will also be MC’d by our very own Maynarde.<br />
<br />
If you weren’t one of the lucky people who got their ticket, never fear, as there will be some ticket giveaways happening over coming weeks. You can also tune in to our high quality stream from midday Saturday at <a href='http://www.twitch.tv/aclprosc2' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>www.twitch.tv/aclprosc2</a>.]]></description>

CouchWarriors will be taking a bit of a different approach to tournaments for the weekend. As everyone will be glued on the action throughout the day on the big screen we'll be running alternative rules to normal tournaments. We're toying with the idea of less "serious" and more fun tournaments such as teams, random, low tier and many others, but we'd love your suggestions. Got a format you think would be fun? Please suggest it over at their <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.facebook.com/events/120378371435067/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>facebook event page</a></strong></span>. The current plan is to run Armies on Sunday for each game. This involves splitting all the competitors into two teams and having them play off against each other while their team cheers them on until only one is left standing. <strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'><a href='http://www.GamingGear.com.au' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>GamingGear.com.au</a></span></strong> will also be on site selling their gear and have even provided an awesome Qanba QRAF4 to give away, you could win it just by attending the event!<br />

<span style='color: #FFA500'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 17px;'>ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 3 Announced</span></span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Gears of War 3 is back after making its debut at its first ever ACL LAN event, with ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 3! Round 3 you say? But there was never a Round 2?! Well that's because the GAMECOM Gauntlet was held in its place, and since that tournament contributed to ACL Season Points we have moved right along to Round 3 for consistency sake. ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 3 will host the best Gears of War 3 teams and players that Australian and New Zealand has ever seen, all fighting for a some very desirable prizes including $200 cash and an Avermedia Game Broadcaster HD for first place! </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Who</strong></span> – ACL<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>What</strong></span> – ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 3<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>When</strong></span> – June 15th, 16th & 17th<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 15th June:</strong> Pool Play (for all teams)<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 16th June:</strong> Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 17th June:</strong> Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Times</strong></span><br />
Friday 6pm AEST<br />
Saturday 2pm AEST<br />
Sunday 2pm AEST<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Prizes</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>1st:</strong> $400<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2nd:</strong> $200 + 1x <a href='http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/Product/ProductDetail.aspx?Id=565' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Avermedia Game Broadcaster HD Capture Card</a><br />

<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play – Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. This is dependent on registration numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST plan ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine the next stage.<br />
<br />
Teams will go head to head on Friday the 15th to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on both Saturday the 16th and Sunday the 17th of June.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination – Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs earlier.  Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement rounds will determine the Overall Points for your placing.<br />
<br />
Double Elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all the tiebreakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed in the DE bracket to fight it out to for the top spot and the prizes that go alongside it.<br />
Double Elimination gameplay will commence 12pm sharp on Saturday the 16th and continue to Sunday the 17th of June.<br />
<br />

The Starcraft II World Championship Series consists of tournaments held in nearly every part of the world, bringing players from all over the globe together to compete for pride, glory and prizes.<br />
<br />
Starting with National Qualifiers, players will battle it out for a chance to prove they have what it takes to be the best in the country, and qualify for the Oceanic Finals in their part of the world. Then, the winners of the Oceanic Finals will earn a place to fight in the Starcraft World Championship Series, where they’ll compete for not only prizes, but the title of World Champion.<br />

More details about this tournament, along with prize details, will be released in the very near future. In the meantime, the qualifiers are starting very soon, so why not be a part of the action? Here’s a list ACL’s Australian Qualifiers.<br />

<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF8C00'>Structure</span></strong><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. This is dependent on registration numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
<br />
Pool play gametypes will look like this - CTF, S&D, CTF.<br />
<br />
There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Invite Pool Play</strong> - Top 4 ranked teams based off 2012 season points.<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Open Pool Play</strong> - Everyone outside the top 4 teams.<br />
<br />
Pool Play will consist of several Open Pools and one Invite Pool (based off of 2012 season points). Teams will go head to head on Saturday the 9th of June in Pool Play to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on Sunday the 10th of June. The top 14 teams by win/loss ratio after Open Pool Play will progress to the Double Elimination bracket in places 5-16. The Invite Pool Play teams will be placed into spots 1-4 in the Double Elimination bracket after the results of their Invite Pool Play matches.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16. If you do not show up to your Placement Rounds you forfeit your chance of earning the best possible result for your team. Double elimination will occur Sunday and be played out all day until a winner is found. <br />
<br />
Double elimination map rotation - CTF, S&D, CTF, S&D, CTF.<br />

The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure season points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual season points tally.<br />

<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. This is dependent on registration numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.<br />

<br />
"<em class='bbc'>It was a bit of a surprise but a welcome one when I heard the ACL team were opening their own gaming house. It's something we have never really seen here in Australia but it makes for a great place for teams to get together for pre-LAN training and even accommodation where possible. My team was lucky enough to secure a place at the Aus Gaming House and they are very keen and excited to check the place out and get in some prep for ACL Sydney! It's a great move by the ACL team and shows just how far they have come and how dedicated they are to providing premier gaming services to Australian gamers</em>."<br />

		<title>ACL Sydney 2012 Wrap Up!</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-sydney-2012-wrap-up-r203</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/aclsydwriteup.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>On the weekend of 21-22 April 2012 the Australian Cyber League hosted its second National event of 2012. The event was held at the University of New South Wales’ Roundhouse and played host to the best gamers from all over Australian and New Zealand.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/test.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
It’s already been a week since the ACL Sydney National event and there is still a buzz in the air. Hundreds of gamers from all over Australia and New Zealand converged on the Roundhouse in Sydney to prove who is the best in their chosen game, and there has never been more at stake at an ACL event. Pride, bragging rights and thousands of dollars in cash and prizes were up for grabs to the victors. Pressure was on our gamers, and they did not disappoint, putting on a show across all of ACL’s supported games, the competition was fierce.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/sc2.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
Fast becoming one of the flasgship games of the ACL Pro Circuit, the Starcraft 2 competition was one of the most exciting, with 66 players in total battling it out for the top spots, first through the open bracket to get into the pro groups, and then from there into our Championship double elimination bracket, where the best of the best fight it out for the top spots and the prizes.<br />
<br />
We’ll skip straight to the pointy end of the competition. After group stages, these were the top 8 players by seeding:<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>1.	xGKing.Pokerface<br />
2.	xGKing.JazBas<br />
3.	Nv.mOOnGLaDe<br />
4.	Tt.PiG<br />
5.	Mf.TargA<br />
6.	SQL.Ninja<br />
7.	xGKing.MaFia<br />
8.	GoSu.tgun</strong><br />
<br />
Something to note would be that ALL 8 players played as Zerg.<br />
<br />
In the early stages of the Championship bracket, games to note would have to be the series of Pig vs Targa, where Pig knocked Targa into the losers bracket in a 2-1 series. Also, no one could forget the match-up of Moonglade vs Mafia. Although it was won by Moonglade in a 2-0 fashion, both games were nail-biting. In the first game, Moonglade held off a Roach timing push from Mafia with what looked like no army and a spine crawler or two. The game turned into a 30 minute 200-200 match with Moonglade’s Macro and unit upgrades eventually winning him the match fairly convincingly.<br />
<br />
In game 2, Mafia decided to try a 10-pool, even using the extractor trick to get a couple more units. He ran in with his Zerglings and even pulled the Drones for the attack. Moonglade happened to spot this half way across the map with his Overlord and cancelled his Hatch he put down. Everyone’s eyes were glued to the build-timer of Moonglade’s own Spawning Pool, as the push from Mafia ran up the ramp. With some amazing micro, Moonglade was able to fend off the attack until he got a few Zerglings of his own. Somehow, to everyone’s astonishment, even the casters, Moonglade fended off the attack before Mafia GG’d and Moonglade won the match and the series.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the Top 3 players, we saw Pig taking on Moonglade in the Winners Bracket Finals, in which he lost 2-1, which saw him up against Targa, whom he eliminated in the first round of the Winners bracket. Both Targa and Pig won a game each, before Targa won the third game and walked away the victor, going into the Championship match against Moonglade. Although both were close games by these skilled players, Moonglade claimed victory over Targa in the final, being named Champion of ACL’s Sydney National event, the second time he has claimed this title this year after his win back at the Gold Coast event.<br />
<br />
When all was said and done, the Top 6 was as follows. Congratulations to our winners!<br />

<br />
Gears of War 3 is the newest title to be added to ACL’s Pro Circuit, after showing massive popularity in our online events and in the recent GAMECOM Gauntlet. ACL Sydney would be Gears’ first LAN event in Australia for most people since 2007, and the first live event held by ACL.<br />
<br />
7 teams made their way to the event to duke it out for the top spot in this brand new game. It was the big names in the Gears scene, however, that showed their dominance. Legacy, Reborn and Malice all proved to be the hardest teams to beat and eventually proved they had what it takes to take the Top 3 spots.<br />
<br />
Going into Day 2, one team pulled out, leaving 6 teams to play in the double elimination bracket. Reborn disposed of Innate Behaviour as did Envious with RNG. It was then favourites of the competition, Legacy, who would come up against the rising force that was Reborn. After an incredibly close to-and-fro series, Legacy eventually won the series 3-2, knocking Reborn into the losers bracket.<br />
<br />
Not to lay around sulking, Reborn quickly put their game face back on to 3-0 RNG in the losers bracket, eliminating them from competition. Also in losers bracket, Envious took on Innate Behaviour to move on in the competition and only just snatched the victory, winning the series 3-2 and also eliminating Innate.<br />
<br />
Towards the end of the competition, it was nothing but close matches and indeed, close series’. Legacy had an amazing winners bracket final up against Malice, eventually toppling them and winning in another 3-2 series. Malice would then play Reborn in the losers bracket finals, but it seemed their loss to Legacy got into their heads a little too much, and they lost 3-0 to Reborn.<br />
<br />
Going into the Championship match, we had a Best-of-11 continuation series of Legacy vs Reborn, and what a series it was! As it was continuation, Legacy started the series up 3-2, however, Reborn quickly won the first game to make it 3-3 in the series. The games would then go one for one to each team until it eventually came down to the last game in the series. Both teams played brilliantly, with Legacy just edging out Reborn becoming ACL’s first National champs for Gears of War 3. Here were the final results:<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>1.	Legacy<br />
2.	Reborn<br />
3.	Malice<br />
4.	Envious<br />

<br />
Continuing its streak of being the most popular console game of 2012, the competition of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 consisted of 12 of the best teams Australia had to offer. ACL live event regulars Mindfreak, VoxE, Fray and Cruelty Incarnate were all in attendance, with those same names eventually taking the tops spots. With a $1000 first prize, the competition was some of the most intense an ACL event has seen.<br />
<br />
Generally, most games were pretty one-sided, with a lot of 3-0 series happening throughout the tournament, in both pools and the double elimination bracket. Most of the action happened from the 3rd round of winners bracket onwards, where Frenetic Array spilt the blood of Vox Eminor, knocking them into the losers bracket, along with Cruelty Incarnate, who were sent to losers bracket by the force of Mindfreak.<br />
<br />
Mindfreak then went up against Frenetic Array in the semi-finals and this was an incredible series. Both teams were very dominant, but it was Frenetic Array who claimed victory in a 3-2 fashion, knocking Mindfreak into the losers bracket, where they would meet Cruelty Incarnate for the losers bracket finals.<br />
<br />
Mindfreak were anything but down and out though, as they thrashed Cruelty Incarnate 3-0 in the losers bracket finals to meet Frenetic Array once again for the Championship match, this time with a vengeance.<br />
<br />
Another game to go to-and-fro, both of these teams weren’t backing down and all games were quite a spectacle. After intense matches and a lot of trash talk, the series eventually went to the 11th game. Unlike the winners bracket final however, the outcome would be different, as Mindfreak got their revenge and defeated Frenetic Array claiming the Modern Warfare 3 championship at ACL Sydney!<br />
<br />
Here are the results:<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>1.	Mindfreak<br />
2.	Frenetic Array<br />
3.	Cruelty Incarnate<br />
4.	Vox Eminor<br />

<br />
While not as popular as it may have been at previous events, players who competed in the Halo Reach event still put on a show, with old names and new blood both in the mix of participants. With past champions Immunity once again not competing, the first place spot was up for grabs.<br />
<br />
After pool play, we saw Kebabulate taking on Immunize, taking them out 3-0 to knock them into losers bracket. Optimal Virus did the same to Maddy & The Boys, to proceed to the next round. It was then Unite, made up of Hopey, Pulse, Halvo and Blaze, that took out Kebabulate 3-0. NBT, with Roosters, Jayden, Haze and, all the way from the USA, Loberg, then put on a show, taking out Optimal Virus and knocking them into the losers bracket.<br />
<br />
After some unfortunate mishaps with timing that affected the competition, Kebabulate eventually defeated Optimal Virus, eliminating them from competition. Unite then played NBT in the winners bracket final which, as with the Kebabulate series, was unfortunately affected by a timing issue. At the end of the series however, it was Unite who emerged the victor. This then meant NBT played Kebabulate in the losers bracket final. Kebabulate quickly fell to NBT, taking our third spot.<br />
<br />
It was then Unite vs NBT on the mainstage in our Championship match. It would be a best-of-9 continuation instead of the usual best-of-11 due to those earlier mentioned timing issues. Although the games were very entertaining, they were very much one-sided. Unite showed their domination, even with little practice, as they defeated NBT 5-1 and claimed our Halo Reach Championship!<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sydney continued its ability to draw in the FIFA crowd, breaking the previous attendance record (20, also at Sydney in 2011)  with 36 players turning up to compete in our FIFA12 competition. Competition was exciting as ever and it was great to finally see some numbers that reflect FIFA’s popularity in the gaming scene.<br />
<br />
Everyone enjoyed the pools and going into double elimination, things got serious. Favourites Muzza, Skip1 and Itz Todd all won their first rounds convincingly. It was in winners bracket round 3 that we saw some exciting games, with ACL’s undefeated champion Muzza take on Team Immunity’s Skip 1. Motivated by not yet taking a win off Muzza in an ACL competition, Skip1 defeated Muzza 2-1, sending him to the losers bracket. In the same round, Itz Todd came up against ACL’s FIFA Admin and Pro Player, Ninja Brett. Perhaps motivated by his new sponsorship with Carnage, Brett was able to take down Itz Todd 2-0, to move onto the winners bracket semis.<br />
<br />
Brett then had to take on the formidable Skip1. Although games were close, Skip1 won the series 2-0, forcing Brett into the losers bracket, and continuing through to the final. In the losers bracket, Todd had to face Muzza but was out-played, as Muzza moved on to face Brett in the losers bracket finals. To most peoples surprise, Brett claimed a stunning victory over Muzza, eliminating him from the competition. This was the first time that Muzza has not won an ACL FIFA competition, and had an incredible 9-in-a-row streak until this event.<br />
<br />
It was then Brett and Skip1 who would face off in the Championship game. The atmosphere was intense as both players made it to the mainstage to play their match. A best-of-3, the series was intense but unfortunately for Brett, very one-sided. Skip1 showed his dominance beating Brett 2-0, with the game scores being 3-0 and 4-0  to Skip. This meant for the first time in 9 events, and the first time ever, Skip1 claimed the FIFA Championship at an ACL event.<br />

<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Register for ACL Sydney:</strong></span><br />
If you haven't registered for ACL Sydney yet, what are you waiting for?!<br />
<br />
To register for this event visit the registration form <strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://registration.aclpro.com.au/?e=65' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>here</a></strong></span></strong> and the Gears of War 3 registration form <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://registration.aclpro.com.au/?e=66' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>here</a></strong></span>.<br />
A week out from the tournament date is confirmation, which will require you to revisit the form and confirm your attendance.<br />
<br />
You can view registered teams and players <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2012/events/sydney/acl-sydney-rego' class='bbc_url' title=''>here</a></strong></span> and Gears of War 3 registered teams <span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2012/events/sydney/acl-sydney-gears3-rego' class='bbc_url' title=''>here</a></strong></span>.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Online Tournament Passes:</strong></span><br />
ACL live events have long been 'pay at the door' type events. While we don't want to stop this service and the convenience of cash, we are trying to limit the administrative duties involved with this process. For starters, teams can sometimes show up last minute or don't confirm their registration. Not knowing confirmed teams can cause problems for table, venue and layout planning. Secondly, the registration process on the day can be vastly streamlined by the prepay process. Thirdly, and more obviously for event organisers, it lessens some of the burden of event costs prior to the date. So at the end of the day the event pricing hasn't changed at all, if you're organised. Pay online early and help us spend more time creating an awesome event for you!<br />
<br />
Head over to ACL's store by clicking on the 'STORE' tab above or head directly there by clicking the link <strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/store/category/4-tournament-passes-prepay-prices-/' class='bbc_url' title=''><span style='color: #0000FF'>here</span></a></strong>. Click on your desired event title and press 'Add to cart', once you are done select 'Checkout' and follow the instructions for payment details. You have the options of Direct Deposit (Bank Transfer) and Paypal.<br />
<br />

		<title>Timeout with HumptyDumpy</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/timeout-with-humptydumpy-r195</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://aclpro.com.au/images/timeouthumpty.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Recently ninja brett from ACL sat down with Humptydumpy a pro FIFA player on ACL. Humpty came third in ACL FIFA Online Round 1 then improved on that placing coming in second in Online Round 2. He will be looking to improve once again on this impressive result come ACL Sydney. Today we get his thoughts from ACL FIFA Online Round 2 and the FIFA scene in Australia.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Thanks for sitting down with me Humpty, can you start off by telling us a bit of information about yourself?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Name:</strong></span> Adam Kharman<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Gamertag: </strong></span>HumptyDumpy<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>State: </strong></span> NSW, Sydney<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Current Team Used: </strong></span>Arsenal<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hobbies: </strong></span>Watching and Playing soccer both virtual and real, table tennis and parties.<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Other Favourite Games:</strong></span> I used to play heaps of COD but once i found competitive fifa, there was no turning back <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Tell us a bit about your gaming background and how long you have been playing FIFA?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Humpty:</strong></span> I have been playing fifa since fifa 2003. I was very young and used to play a lot with my older brother, once i got xbox live when fifa08 came out. It became my passion and i was roughly ranked in the top 300 in the world. After FIFA 2008 i moved onto COD for a few years, but after FIWC 2010 i regained my love for FIFA and soon found out about other competitive tournaments. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Can you tell us some of past achievement and tournament/competition placings in FIFA?</strong></span><br />
 <br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Humpty:</strong></span> Well my first tournament was FiWC 2010 in which i made the final 16 at the Australian live event. The following year at FiWC 2011 i made the final 32 in the Australian live event. <br />
Since FIWC i played in lots of ACL tournaments and made the top 3 in every ACL tournament ive played in, which includes ACL Sydney LAN 2011, ACL online round 3 2011, ACL online round 1 and 2 2012. My highest placement was runner up in ACL or3 2011 and ACL or2 2012. Also, i came third in FIFA 11 CyberGamer finals series last year.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Now on to your own performance, and how you performed throughout the tournament, You lost in WBR2 and were then put into loser bracket how did that effect you?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Humpty:</strong></span> It seems to be an ongoing trend in losing early in the winners bracket, but i think i always find a way to grind through the losers bracket. In 3/4 ACL tournaments i have competed in, i have fought my way into  the top 3 from the losers bracket. I guess it may be the added pressure that makes me step up my game. <br />
Also I like to think of a famous Muzza255 quote - "Champions are made in the losers bracket!"<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Coming into the Grand Final of ACL FIFA Online Round 2 you were facing Muzza who made it all the way through the Winners Bracket. How were you feeling coming into the Grand Final? Were you confident you could take it out? Or worried that Muzza had the advantage?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Humpty:</strong></span> Well my goal for ACL Online round 2 was to make the grandfinal, and once I got there I felt lots of relief. Obviously having to play someone like Muzza isn't ideal, but my results against Muzza in fifa 12 are actually relatively good and in ACL Online round 1 when we met in LBF he only won by aggregate, so i felt it was possible. However, muzza was yet to not win a match and produced some ridiculous scorelines in the winners bracket, and was simply the better player in the final.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Were there any results that surprised you in ACL FIFA Online Round 2? Any players that exceeded expectations or any ‘upsets’ you didn’t expect?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Humpty:</strong></span> From what i can remember, there wasn't an awful lot of surprises but i think RVP did extremely well coming from open pool play to make the top 4. When I played him in losers bracket round 5, he won the first match 2-0 and was leading 1-0 in the second match at half time. I managed to turn it around and luck was a bit on my side but he played very well and is a top player. <br />
Also, DmAuViIrD defeating Skip1 in the winners bracket caused quite a stir.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: You attended your first LAN which was ACL Sydney last year were you placed an impressive 3rd, how are you feeling about ACL Sydney this year? </strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Humpty:</strong></span> I thought ACL Sydney was an awesome tournament and that's when i realised the quality of ACL's top players. The final between Muzza and Skip1 was so tense and controversial, and the nerves I experienced at LAN were really insane. <br />
I will definately be attending ACL Sydney this year, and I think lots of people will turn up. The quality of matches should be just as good as last year and it will be an awesome experience.<br />
<br />

		<title>ACL Design a Hoodie 2012</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-design-a-hoodie-2012-r192</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/aclhoodie2012a.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Win $200 designing ACL's 2012 Hoodie!</strong></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>So ACL hoodies are back, and once again we are looking for someone in the community to design it for us. This is what previous ACL hoodies have looked like:</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2011 Hoodie Samples</strong><br />
<img src='http://i986.photobucket.com/albums/ae349/comablack84/whitehoodie-1.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<img src='http://i986.photobucket.com/albums/ae349/comablack84/blackcopy-2.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2010 Hoodie Samples</strong><br />
<img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/2010hoodies.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<br />
We're making a call for all designers out there to get creative and make a new design for us in 2012. I can have GFX fail (above banner supplied by me). Not only will you win $200, but you'll have your handywork on every supporting member's hot gaming bod for many cold years ahead. How cool would it be to see some dude you have never met wearing your design. Pretty mint.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Design Requirements:</strong><br />
<br />
Ok, so you have skills, but do you have skills with vectors? Don't know what they are? Google them. Basically, they're a type of line that can be resized without losing quality. The average photoshop design uses pixels. What happens when you resize pixels? Your pixels grow in size with your image, rather than creating many more new pixels. This means your image becomes (wait for it)....... PIXELATED and the quality goes to poo. If the printing company needs to print your image on a hoodie, they'll need the best possible quality image they can have. That's why it's best to design from scratch in Adobe Illustrator or Correl Draw or something like that using vectors. If you're unsure, contact a printing company and see what they usually require <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Competition Clauses:</strong><br />
<br />
- We are not going to hand over $200 to just any old design, so this competition may have NO winner if the folk at ACL aren't happy with what we're shown. <br />
- If the design is awesome, but not in the right format, then I still can't award you a winner. <br />
- The design will be judged by ACL staff, based on the opinions shown in the ACL forums.<br />
- Must include ACLPRO.COM.AU, and a place for individual gamertags on the back <br />
- The deadline will be April 12th 2012, there is no exception to this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>How to submit design:</strong><br />
-To submit your design either post in the thread, PM me <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/index.php?app=members&module=messaging&section=send&do=form&fromMemberID=913' class='bbc_url' title=''>here</a>"]here[/url] or add me on skype at brett.newton13<br />

		<title>ACL Sydney Tournament Passes Available Now</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-sydney-tournament-passes-available-now-r187</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/sydpasses.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='font-size: 21px;'>ACL Sydney Tournament Passes Now Available!</span></span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>ACL Sydney is just over a month away and is gearing up to be one of our best events yet. In preparation for the event tournament passes are now available online for all competitions providing the luxury of sorting out payment well in advance. Passes for team games and single player games alike can be purchased through our store system right now and provide competitors cheaper entry then paying at the door!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 21px;'><span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/store/category/4-tournament-passes-prepay-prices-/' class='bbc_url' title=''>Buy your ACL Sydney tournament pass now!</a></span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>How it Works</strong></span></span><br />
Paying early online through our store system secures your spot in the tournament and allows you or your team cheaper entry to the event.<br />
<br />
<em class='bbc'>Example: Starcraft 2</em><br />
<br />
$20 Pre-pay online for OPEN BRACKET Entry<br />
$25 At the door for OPEN BRACKET Entry <br />
- Top 8 from OPEN BRACKET pay additional $20 to compete in PRO BRACKET (total $40-$45)<br />
<br />
$40 Pre-pay online for PRO BRACKET Entry<br />
$45 At the door for PRO BRACKET Entry<br />
<br />
<em class='bbc'>Example: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em><br />
<br />
$45 Pre-pay online<br />
$50 At the door<br />
<br />
<em class='bbc'>Example: FIFA 12</em><br />
<br />
$10 Pre-pay online for OPEN BRACKET Entry<br />
$15 at the door<br />
 - Top 8 from OPEN BRACKET pay additional $25<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>All tournament passes are $5 cheaper paying early online than paying at the door at ACL Sydney on the day!</strong><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Why the change?</strong></span></span><br />
ACL competitions have long been 'pay at the door' type events. While we don't want to stop this service and the convenience of cash, we are trying to limit the administrative duties involved with this process. For starters, teams can sometimes show up last minute or don't confirm their registration. Not knowing confirmed teams can cause problems for table, venue and layout planning. Secondly, the registration process on the day can be vastly streamlined by the prepay process. Thirdly, and more obviously for event organisers, it lessens some of the burden of event costs prior to the date.<br />
<br />
So at the end of the day the event pricing hasn't changed at all, if you're organised. Pay online early and help us spend more time creating an awesome event for you!<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Where To Pay</strong></span></span><br />
Head over to ACL's store by clicking on the 'STORE' tab above or head directly there by clicking the link <span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/store/category/4-tournament-passes-prepay-prices-/' class='bbc_url' title=''>HERE</a></strong></span>. Click on your desired event title and press 'Add to cart', once you are done select 'Checkout' and follow the instructions for payment details. You have the options of Direct Deposit (Bank Transfer) and Paypal.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>ACL Sydney Titles & Online Pass Prices</strong></span></span><br />

<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FFA500'>GAMECOM has had a hugely successful launch week to their new community portal here down under. To keep things cranking along, they are proud to announce something very special, their first online competition being run on the GAMECOM website. The rise and rise of the Gears of War 3 community is something GAMECOM is choosing not to ignore but rather celebrate, so its fitting for the hit console title to be supported by them for their next online event.</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>A prize announcement will follow in the next few days, but rest assured this will be a competition you don't want to miss. To sweeten the deal GAMECOM has joined forces with one of its partners in ACL to help award season points for their 2012 Pro Circuit. This means that by competing in the GAMECOM GAUNTLET you will be earning valuable seeding points for their Sydney LAN event in April.<br />
<br />
GAMECOM have asked the most respected game administrators; Midnite and his support staff to run the tournament, with the rules he used for earlier ACL Online rounds in effect. This great team of staff, and no doubt upcoming announcements for a live stream and commentary should make for a thrilling weekend of Gears 3 entertainment and gruelling competition.<br />
<br />
Due to exceptionally high demand on their new website, GAMECOM have asked community partners to help launch their new competition while they transfer hosting. This means that all you need to do to register is to send an email to <span style='color: #0000FF'>registrations@gamecom.com.au </span> following the set format described below.</span></strong><br />

<strong class='bbc'>What’re we playing for?</strong><br />
To be announced on <a href='http://www.gamecom.com.au' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>http://www.gamecom.com.au</a> in coming days<br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 15px;'><span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play – Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have (tba – usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST plan ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine the next stage.<br />
<br />
Teams will go head to head on Friday the 30th and finishing on Saturday the 31st of March in a Round Robin tournament to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on both Saturday the 31st and Sunday the 1st of April.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination – Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs earlier.  Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement rounds will determine the Overall Points for your placing.<br />
<br />
Double Elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all the tiebreakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed in the DE bracket to fight it out to for the top spot and the prizes that go alongside it.<br />
Double Elimination gameplay will commence straight after the last pool play matches have been <br />
played on Saturday the 30th and will run through to Sunday the 31st of March.<br />
Registration & Confirmation<br />

		<title>ACL Halo Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 Announced</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-halo-reach-4v4-online-round-2-announced-r178</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i40.tinypic.com/29f9la8.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The second Halo: Reach 4v4 online event of the 2012 circuit has been announced for mid March!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
The second Online Round of the 2012 Halo:Reach circuit is officially announced! This is your third chance to secure season points for the best possible ranking at the national championships later this year.  With MindFreak being our Gold Coast winners, who has what it takes to dethrone them as the number  1 seed? Dont miss your chance to take on the best in the second Online Round of 2012.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>What</strong></span></span><br />
The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure ranking points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual score.<br />
<br />
See the ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 landing page <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2012/events/halo/acl-reach-4v4-or2-landing-page' class='bbc_url' title=''><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>here</span></strong></a>.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>When</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>9th March - 11th March</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>LESS THAN 24 TEAMS - NO OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 10th Marchh:</strong> Pool Play (for all teams)<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 11th March:</strong> Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>MORE THAN 24 TEAMS - OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 9th March: </strong>Open Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 10th March:</strong> Open Double Elim/Pro Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 11th March:</strong> Pro Double Elim<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>TIMES</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 6pm AEDT</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 12pm AEDT</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 12pm AEDT</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.<br />

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Recently Beware from ACL sat down with DaveFromTesltra from Gears of War 3 team Legacy. DaveFromTesltra and his team Legacy took out ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 and are looking to do the same coming into ACL Sydney. Today we get his thoughts from ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1, information about the growing and dominate Gears scene in Australia and whats coming up ahead for Legacy.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Thanks for sitting down with me Dave, can you start off by telling us a bit of information about yourself?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Name:</strong></span> Jay Lloyd<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Gamertag: </strong></span>DaveFromTelstra<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>State: </strong></span> NSW on the Central Coast<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Current Team: </strong></span>Legacy<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Favourite Gametype & Map:</strong></span>  KOTH Rustlung<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hobbies: </strong></span>My only real hobby would have to be gaming<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Other Favourite Games:</strong></span> The only game I really play at all is Gears of War 3<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Tell us a bit about your gaming background and how long you have been playing the Gears series?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> Well like most people I initially bought a xbox to play Halo 3 casually. Then like everyone else I moved on to CoD. Around when MW2 was all hacks etc I started playing Gears which would of been early 2010 but I only just started playing Gears competitively of recent on Gears 3 before that I had only played scrims.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Can you tell us some of past achievement and tournament/competition wins in the Gears series?</strong></span><br />
 <br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> None by myself personally but my team held first spot on Gears 2 from beginning to end and they also won the only Cybergamer tournament held for it.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Some people who are reading this interview won’t know a great deal about the Gears community. Can you give us a bit of background about the Gears community? How big you guys are? How long you guys have been active?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> The Gears communty isn't anywhere near as big as CoD but the commitment and dedication shown throughout it is what makes Gears excel in Australia. Everyone knows everyone whether it be the public side or competitive. Gears 3 is only begining to grow again in Australia as majority of it's players left with the mistake of Gears 2, but with Gears 3 the dedication whether it be old or newplayers we all strat/scrim/practice as heavily as any other successful e-sports title. My team will personally practice/scrim etc every couple of days now just to stay on top of our game.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: On to ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1. Can you give the readers your overall opinion of the tournament and how it went?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> The tournament was great it was a major success in my opinion, even it was only to show that Gears 3 can be a successful game on the ACL circuit in Australia. It was also the first tournament Gears 3 has had in Australia, so it gave everyone a taste of what it's like whether they chose to play or spectate.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Now on to your own team, Legacy, and how your team performed throughout the tournament. Many were predicting you guys to win the tournament and it seemed a mere question of who had the biggest chance of beating you guys. During the tournament however Legacy got knocked down to the Losers Bracket by Team Obscure, the result of this shocked pretty much everyone. Can you tell the readers what attributed to this? And what was going through your teams mind during that series?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> During that series we had a few internet problems resulting in a player lagging out in our KOTH game. We also had technical problems on another players end where certain buttons weren't working on their controller but overall we just underestestimated them. We weren't discouraged even after our loss as we felt like we could play much better. So throughout the rest of the tournament we played at 100% and won 18 maps straight to win the whole tournament from there.<br />

<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>Legacy displayed an incredible run through the losers bracket to win ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 where they took down many strong teams, including Malice.</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Is it true that your series loss against Obscure was only your second series loss since Gears of War 3 was released? How has Legacy managed to stay so dominant in Gears of War 3?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> I think it's definitely been the skill gap as we've only really started strating etc now 5 months after release but now you'll see teams coming closer or even beating us these days because they're finding more adaptive ways to play the game. Every strat on this game has its counter strat its just been an execution thing in the past where as now teams are reaching a higher skill cap, which is making these things easier to acheive.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Coming into the Grand Final of ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 you were facing Teknicity who made their run all the way through the Winners Bracket, meaning you had to beat them twice (6 wins). How was your team feeling coming into the Grand Finals? Were you confident you could take it out? Or worried that Teknicity had the advantage (only having to win one best of 5 series)?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> We were very confident coming in to the Grand Final. We're probably Teknicity's bogey team in my opinion as we've never dropped a map to them on the Gears 3 ladders before and have very good understanding of how Teknicity play out their matches as we've versed them many times on Gears 2. Not to mention we were on a massive win steak already so confidence wasn't an issue.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Were there any results that surprised you in ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1? Any teams you expected to do better or any ‘upsets’ you didn’t expect?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> Yes a few besides us losing against Obscure. I expected BBR to go staight to the finals and I also expected Dark Sided to beat Innate Behaviour as Dark Sided have been a top team since Gears 1 and definitely deserved a better placing then top ten. I also expected Euphoric Gaming Network to make it past Pool Play as they're easily a top 10 team in my opinion but it's just how these things play out and it's also half the fun.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: What did you think of the coverage of the event? Vero Prodigy, Strangulate, Gandhi, Fallout and even our very own ACL Gears Admin Midnite all taking turns commentating and streaming games.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> I thought it was great and overall I'd give majority of the praise to Midnite as he was the one who orgainised all these things. As a player having to organise and keep order of the entire tournament by yourself in between games can take it's toll on him and his team. I'd also like to thank him again on the fact that the $400 prize money came directly out of his pocket,  I think it also shows his dedication to Gears of War 3 and how much he's willing to do to help competitive Gears 3 succeed in Australia.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 hosted an amazing talent of casters for spectators and players alike to enjoy. Check out this game with Commentary from ex-Halo professional player and MLG Halo commentator Gandhi and MLG Gears coach Vero Prodigy.</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Looking forward to future tournament, your team Legacy has recently made an announcement that you are looking for a new player. What has caused this team change decision? And how is the recruitment process going?</strong></span> <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> Well we were only really looking for an experienced and well-rounded sub. We sometimes struggle to get enough players on to scrim meaning we weren't getting enough practice in but in the last couple of days we've picked up Aesthetic Mango. So now when 3 of our core members are online we have another player that can fill the void left by the missing player.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: ACL Sydney is less then 2 months away now and of course we will be hosting Gears of War 3 for the first time ever at an ACL Event. How are Legacy feeling going into the event? Also I’ve been told this is the first major Australian LAN event for the Gears series since 2007, will this be your teams first LAN event?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> Yes this will be our teams first LAN event. Overall we are just very excited to attend LAN regarless whether we win or lose. This will be the first time we've met all these players we've known for years and we think it will be an overall amazing experience one of which I think you'd be crazy to miss out on. Of course we will still be entering with the desire to win and with enough preparation we believe this can be achieved.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Based on the teams registered for ACL Sydney and the teams you know will be attending how do you think the results will end up? Do you think your team can take it out? And what teams do you expect to contest you guys for the top spot?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> I think it will be another success. I'd say around now we're looking at 14+ plus teams entering. I think aslong as we enter with the right mental attitudes we can take this event out. Between all the top teams I'd say the major contenders would have to be Legacy, Team BBR, Teknicity, Malice and Dark Sided. I couldn't tell you which teams will be playing off in the Final, but I can say that we'll be one of them.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.com/v/UXYetob1yDI&hd=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://youtube.com/v/UXYetob1yDI&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="640" height="390"></embed></object></span><br />
<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>Expect a lot more of this at ACL Sydney, only hosting a lot more Gears action!</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: With all the hype around ACL Sydney there has even been some talk about European teams coming over to compete. The European CoD team Apex has strongly hinted they may be making an appearance and perhaps a Gears team will be coming with them. If a European Gears team does come over do you think Legacy or any other attending Australian team will have what it takes to contest them?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> I think that if we're on our game then we definitely have a massive chance of taking them out especially if we play like we did in the ACL Online Round 1. The major factor would be LAN experience as we've never played LAN we don't know what to expect and if anything that will be our downfall.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Lastly, looking at the international Gears of War 3 scene, MLG recently made the announcement that Gears will not be featured for their Winter Season. What do you think of this decision? With all the enthusiasm being displayed internationally for Gears and Hypefestation in America do you think it was a bad idea for MLG to not capitalise on this? Is Gears more popular worldwide then most think?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> Gears 3 is definitely more popular worldwide than what most people think. It's bigger than many games that are taken more serious. I think MLG have made the wrong decision for the time being but I don't see it being all done and dusted for Gears 3 and MLG. It will continue to grow worldwide through other events and all the players dedication and loyalty to the game they love.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Thanks for taking the time to chat with us today Dave. Before you go however, do you have any shoutouts?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Dave:</strong></span> Shoutout to Aesthetic Mango and my cold dinner.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Thanks again Dave and good luck to yourself and Legacy in 2012!</strong></span>]]></description>

		<title>ACL - Mass Effect 3 Launch</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-mass-effect-3-launch-r182</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Once again the great folks at EA Australia showed us and the Australian gaming scene why they are one of the most community involved game development companies out there. A few of us from ACL got invited to the launch of their next huge title Mass Effect 3 (which hits shelves on March 8th) at Soho.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e299/ernzor/ACLPro/photo1.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
</span><br />
We were treated to an extended playable demo of the game, which if you have played the downloadable demo you will know how good this was as we got to play further into the game. There was also a guest appearance by Associate Producer at EA - Robyn Theberge, who gave a short talk about the game and concluded with the newly released extended trailer which if you haven’t seen you simply must have a look at.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.com/v/eBktyyaV9LY"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://youtube.com/v/eBktyyaV9LY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="640" height="390"></embed></object></span><br />
<br />
If you have been living on mars and have no idea what the Mass Effect series is all about, well you have a few weeks to get up to speed and I suggest you do. The storyline of the series is one of the strongest and deepest out of all the games I have come across. Ever. Without spoiling any of them for you, the tag line for ME3 which I am sure you have heard is “Take Back Earth”. So come March 8th, that’s what will be happening, earth will be taken back by millions of Shepards.<br />
<br />
Our hosts for the night were of course Pidgeo and Jiggsy who energetically kept the night rolling with prizes and information. As a team these two are really keeping the community up to date and involved with what EA has in store, not just with ME3 but also with the rest of their upcoming lineup. The support that these two and the rest of EA show ACL, eSports and the Australian gaming community in general is absolutely outstanding. <br />
<br />
I have to mention too that a combination of a green screen, open bar and young adults made for some interesting pictures. Everyone had the opportunity to have their photo taken in front of a green screen and then merged into the body of Shepard (the protagonist of the Mass Effect series). Most did a serious one first up, as who doesn’t want to picture themselves as Shepard. After this though when the queues died down, more and more shall we say, interesting, pictures were taken. I am sure some of them will make an appearance online sometime. So we will have to keep our eyes out for them. <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e299/ernzor/ACLPro/photo5.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
</span><br />
The live music (Sydney CON artists performing Mass Effect 3 tracks), DJs, Cosplayers, free food and open bar made for a great night. Thanks again EA Australia!<br />

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>Come one, come all to the 2012 ACL Modern Warfare 3 Pro Circuit! Up next for you guys is the second MW3 Online Tournament for 2012, a free to play one weekend tournament for bragging rights and valuable ACL season points. Gather your team and compete against the best Australia and New Zealand has to offer. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ACL COD Modern Warfare 3 Online Round 2!</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Who:</strong></span> ACL<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>What:</strong></span> CoD: MW3 Online Round 2<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>When:</strong></span> March 16<sup class='bbc'>th</sup>, 17<sup class='bbc'>th</sup> & 18<sup class='bbc'>th</sup><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF8C00'>Structure</span></strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-6) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
<br />
Pool play gametypes will look like this - CTF, S&D, CTF.<br />
<br />
There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pro Pool Play</strong> - Top 6 ranked teams based off 2012 season points.<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Open Pool Play</strong> - Everyone outside the top 6 teams.<br />
<br />
Pool Play will consist of several Open Pools and one Pro Pool (based off of 2012 season points). Teams will go head to head on Friday the 16<sup class='bbc'>th</sup> of March and finishing Saturday the 17<sup class='bbc'>th</sup> of March in a Round Robin tournament to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on both Saturday the 17<sup class='bbc'>th</sup> and Sunday the 18<sup class='bbc'>th</sup> of March.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.<br />
<br />
Double elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all tie breakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed into the top 16 double elimination bracket to fight it out for the number one spot. Double elimination gameplay will commence straight after the last pool play matches have been played on Saturday the 17<sup class='bbc'>th</sup> of March and run until Sunday the 18<sup class='bbc'>th</sup> of March.<br />
<br />
Double elimination map rotation - CTF, S&D, CTF, S&D, CTF.<br />

		<title>ACL Nationals 2012 Draft Schedule</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FF8C00'><span style='font-size: 26px;'>ACL Nationals 2012 Draft Schedule</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<img src='http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/8788/calendarf.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'>ACL is pleased to announce a draft plan of its 2012 season schedule for National events. These are the 'big ones' that every gamer will be excited for, with the biggest attendance and cash prizes! </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><span style='font-size: 21px;'>Season Insight</span></span></span><br />
<br />
Don't forget ACL will still be running Regional events in capital cities another 3 times this year, earning much needed season points to seed your team for the National events.<br />
<br />
So to re-iterate a few things that represent changes in 2012:<br />
<br />
- There are now 3 components to earn season points. These are named below<br />
<br />
- <strong class='bbc'>ACL Nationals.</strong> A National level live event with the biggest cash prizes and attendance. These occur 3-4 times a year. Typically 200-300 gamers vie for the most season points on offer - <em class='bbc'>100% of points.</em><br />
- <strong class='bbc'>ACL Regionals. </strong> A regional level live event held in capital cities around Australia (including Perth & Adelaide). These events are SPLIT per title and usually field 30-40 gamers per event. We will have regionals for Halo, Mw3, SC2 and I am pleased to guarantee regionals for Fifa12. These events garner more season points than online events - <em class='bbc'>60% of points.</em><br />
- <strong class='bbc'>ACL Online Rounds.</strong> An online event open to everyone in Australia & NZ. These are fiercely competitive and field between 100-200 gamers, but points distribution is lowest due to the unequal playing field presented by the online medium - <em class='bbc'>40% of points.</em><br />
<br />
- 'ACL Nationals' is the new name for our biggest national scale events. These will no longer be called by the previous system (eg. Sydney LAN) as this could cause confusion with Regional events.<br />
<br />
- An <strong class='bbc'>ACL NATIONAL FINALS</strong> event will be held this year on top of 3 preceding events. Details on this are yet to be confirmed, but ACL is aiming to make this event bigger and better than any National event ever before. <br />
<br />
- Points will mean even more this year and getting into the top 8 teams prior to the ACL National Finals will ensure something extra special.<br />
<br />
<br />

		<title>ACL Community Halo 3 Tournament</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-community-halo-3-tournament-r177</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/Halo3CommunityTournament610x200.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL Community Halo 3 MLG Tournament!</strong></span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Fresh off the launch of ACL Community we are pleased to announce the second ACL Community tournament of 2012 with a blast from the past! Thats right, you read correct, one of the most popular console titles ever is making a return to ACL for the weekend. Don't miss your chance to play Halo 3 just like we did back in 2007-2010 with the rest of the Australian and New Zealand community. </strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Details</strong></span><br />
How do ACL Community tournaments vary from ACL Online Rounds? ACL Community tournaments are purely for fun! There are no valuable season points to be earned, just a chance to sign up to play with some mates or your team in a tournament filled the perfect mix of competitive and social fun!<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>When</strong></span><br />
Saturday the 4th of February and Sunday the 5th of February. <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play</strong> - Saturday the 4th of February<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination</strong> - Sunday the 5th of February. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>TIMES</strong></span><br />
4th February - 2pm (AEST)<br />
5th February - 11am (AEST)<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Pool Play will be run on Saturday the 4th of February. All Pool Play matches must be competed by Saturday night. Each Pool will have (TBA - usually between 4-6) teams, this is dependent on registration numbers and could change. Each series teams MUST play ALL 3 games and there is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16. If teams opt to not play Placements Rounds then their final placing will be determined by their seeds from Pool Play.<br />

<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='font-size: 21px;'>ACL Gold Coast League 1 - National Starcraft II Event</span></span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'>ACL Gold Coast is just around the corner. All of the qualifying rounds and competitions have been played and the final standings are in. For those new to the format, we have seen Regional live events right around Australia and an online competition to finalise these seedings for the Gold Coast. This will mark the culmination of the first 'League' and there will be 3 more Leagues before the end of the 2012 Pro Circuit. Moving forward there will be a change to the structure for Online competitions. There will be 3 x Online comps in each League, with less weighting. This will make attending events and earning points even easier for those busy gamers among us. All of these structure elements are detailed <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/procircuit/sc2-structure-2012' class='bbc_url' title=''>on this Rules & Structure page.</a></span><br />

<strong class='bbc'>Spectating</strong><br />
As this is the first event we've run in conjunction with a gaming convention, there is a small surcharge for spectating the ACL events. In the past, spectating has been free.

<br />
$15 for 2 days spectator access.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Parking</strong><br />
Parking is free and there are numerous parking spaces available. As shown on the map above the recommended parking areas are marked in black.<br />

The Bond Cafe will be opened on the weekend and can be located across the lake from the venue.

		<title>ACL Fifa OR1 Wrap Up</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-fifa-or1-wrap-up-r175</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/2268/articlef.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><span style='color: #FFA500'>ACL Fifa 12 Online Round 1 Wrap Up</span></span></span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>The 9th of January saw ACLPro kick off its first Online Round for FIFA 12. Being the first Online Round of the season, the points from the previous season were used in the seeding process to determine the pro players for this competition. This meant that the 8 highest scoring players from last season <br />
were deemed “pro” players and everybody else was an open player.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>Pool Play</span></strong></span><br />
Monday night saw all of the open players compete against other players in their respective pools to determine who made the open double elimination. Once the pool play games had been played, the double elimination for the open players was played over Tuesday and Wednesday night. While the open players were involved in their pool play and double elimination, the pro players were allocated those three days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) to play their pool play games. The pro pool contained these 8 players:<br />
<br />
HumptyDumpty<br />
iCripsy<br />
Irishtanker<br />
MF Jtino<br />
Muzza255<br />
iM skip intel<br />
xx iTz Todd<br />
Lakey64<br />
<br />
The open bracket saw some familiar players sign up such as Lion Tamer92, Shadi The Daddy, along with some new players such as Air JJx and I am a Zyzz. After the open pool play, the double elimination seeds looked like this:<br />
<br />
1 LioN TaMeR 92<br />
2 SHaDi the DaDDY<br />
3 THE INF3RNO<br />
4 s0seen<br />
5 sretzooR<br />
6 MF Blaze<br />
7 AirJJ x<br />
8 I am a Zyzz<br />
9 Walshizm<br />
10 fray Geemon<br />
11 SiIverblade<br />
12 daft gc<br />
13 KronicStunnah<br />
14 nR Omen<br />
15 Another Benco<br />
16 Forlaan<br />
<br />
After a gruelling two days for all of these players, 8 of them played their way onto the pro double elimination. AirJJ x surprised players by taking the top seed for the open players. Another surprise in the open double elimination was to see the Community Shield winner, ‘Shadi The Daddy’ fall out of the competition without making the top 8. <br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'><br />
Pro Double Elimination</span></strong></span><br />
The pro pool play followed a similar fashion – The usual suspects such as Muzza and Skip took out the top seeds. Despite having top seeds, both players were contested on some occasions dropping games to Todd and Cripsy. Once both open and pro pools had their seedings, all 16 players were placed into the pro double elimination with these seeds:<br />
<br />
1 fray Muzza<br />
2 iM Skip1 intel<br />
3 HumptyDumpy<br />
4 iCripsy<br />
5 MF Jtino<br />
6 xx iTz Todd<br />
7 Lakey64<br />
8 IrishTanker<br />
9 AirJJ x<br />
10 Lion Tamer 92<br />
11 another benco<br />
12 THE INF3RNO<br />
13 SiIverblade<br />
14 daft gc<br />
15 s0seen<br />
16 sretsooR<br />
<br />
The winner’s bracket round 1 saw multiple good games and surprisingly only saw 1 pro player lose their first series in the double elimination. Winner’s bracket round 2 saw Muzza take on Air JJx, which was always going to be a tough series. Air JJx managed to take a game off Muzza but couldn’t quite deliver the final blow, allowing Muzza to dominate in the 3rd game showing why he’s one of the best in Australia. Another tight series in the WBR2 was Cripsy against Brett. Cripsy’s Brazilian attack showed to be too powerful for Brett’s defensive efforts with Manchester City, winning the series with two games, with the scores of 3-1 and 2-1. <br />
<br />
HumptyDumpty vs Todd was also another tight series in the WBR2. Humpty started his ACLPro season strong by punishing daft gc, but his glory and success was short lived after struggling to threaten Todd’s defence. Humpty eventually went down to Todd in straight games losing 2-1 and 2-1. The final series in the WBR2 was Skip against Lakey64. Skip managed to hold Lakey goalless in both games winning 1-0 and 1-0 in a gruelling series.<br />
<br />
Winner’s bracket round 3 saw Cripsy take on Muzza and Todd take on Skip. Cripsy played well to gain a win against Muzza but not well enough to win the series. Muzza continued his fine form winning the series after 3 games, winning 2-1, 3-1 and losing 2-0. In the WBR3 game on the opposite side of the bracket, Todd was a little bit more unlucky than Cripsy going down to Skip 3-1 and 4-0. This set up a usual Winner’s bracket final between Skip and Muzza. <br />
LBR1 and LBR2 showed a few of the open players drop out of the competition along with Irishtanker who was unlucky to not progress further in the competition. In the LBR3, Lion Tamer played against Brett and Humpty played against Lakey. HumptyDumpty played quite well against Lakey managing to win both games against him earning himself a place in the LBR4. After his 3-1 and 1-0 wins, Humpty had this to say: <br />
<br />
“Very comfortable wins for humpty. There were absolutely no chances for Lakey. Some may wonder why he is even considered a pro player.”<br />
After hearing Humpty’s words of confidence, I caught up with Lakey to ask him what he thought about these claims.<br />
<br />
“I can’t take what he has said seriously; I honestly thought it was a massive joke. I defeated him comfortably in the last tournament and he sucked up to me claiming I was the best player and now he is questioning my pro player status… Interesting."<br />
<br />
In the other game in the LBR3, Liontamer started his series convincingly winning 5-0 in his first game. After losing his first game quite embarrassingly, Brett decided to step it up a notch and show Tamer that he deserved the spot in the next round more than he did. Brett won the second game 4-2 and then the third game 2-0 to make his way into the LBR4 against Todd.<br />
<br />
Both of the series in LBR4 saw all four players have to play in 3 games to decide a winner to progress through to the LBR5. Todd successfully played his way through to the next round without dropping a game, winning 2-1 and 5-1 whilst sharing a tied game at 2-2. In the other game, Humpty lost the first game 1-0, won the second game 3-1 and then tied the 3rd game 1-1 with a 90th minute equaliser from Walcott. This meant that Humpty progressed to the LBR5 against Todd on an aggregate of 5-4.<br />
<br />
The LBR5 was a three game series between HumptyDumpty and xx iTz Todd. The first game of the three was a narrow 1-1 draw. The first scoreline suggested that the following games were also going to be close; both of the following games indeed were. Humpty used Walcott’s pace to his advantage to score a late winner at the 87th minute to give him a 2-1 win heading into the 3rd game. The final game of the series was another nail biter resulting in a 4-4 draw with two 90th minute goals. This meant that Humpty progressed through to the LBF with an aggregate score of 7-6.<br />
<br />
 The WBF consisted of Muzza and Skip battling it out to earn a place in the Grand Final for ACLPro’s first Online Round for FIFA 12 in 2012. Skip showed Muzza that he was extremely keen to win his first ACL event by punishing Muzza 3-1 and 5-2. This meant that Skip progressed to the Grand Final to verse the winner of HumptyDumpty and Muzza255. <br />
<br />
There were rumours floating around before the LBF started that Muzza actually threw his previous games just to keep his legacy alive. Nearly every ACL event that Muzza has won, he’s done so by coming through the loser’s bracket. This explains some of the speculation behind the claims that he had thrown his games. Muzza later confirmed that he did not throw his games against skip and stated that he just simply lost.<br />
<br />
Humpty challenged Muzza on all fronts during their LBF but unluckily could not come out on top. It was a three game series with Muzza progressing to the final on an aggregate score of 8-6. Muzza won 4-1, tied 2-2 and lost 3-2. We believe that after Humpty’s match though, he took a little bit of a fall after his defeat…<br />
<br />
Only two players remained at this time. The legendary Muzza255 and the everstrong iM Skip1 intel. Both players aiming to take out the title as ACL's first online round winner for 2012. Muzza took an early lead in the series grasping a tight 1-0 win over Skip in their first game. The second game immediately followed with a reversal of the scoreline - Skip winning a very narrow second game 1-0. This left only one game in the series between the two talented players. If you could pick any winner between these two, who would it be? Well you're wrong. The third game of the series ended in a 1-1 draw which meant that this intense match up needed to go into a fourth game, a golden goal game of fifa. The first player to score in this fourth match would automatically win the final game declaring them the winner.<br />
<br />
45 minutes of intense gameplay passed without a single goal being scored. Roughly 10 minutes after the half time interval, Muzza broke the deadlock scoring the winner in the 55th minute. After 3 and a half games of fifa and 325 minutes of gameplay, Muzza earned the title of being ACL's first online round winner.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Muzza for taking out the competition! Stay tuned to see an interview between Muzza and myself! <br />

<span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 17px;'>ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 Announced</span></span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FFA500'>Here at ACL we are proud to announce something very special - Gears 3 has been added officially to our 2012 Pro Circuit !! This means that ACL staff will be dedicated to running both online competitions and live events for the Gears community. This support will see GOW 3 players side by side with the biggest competitive titles in the world at ACL events, sharing time on the main stage and a full quality production live stream. At the moment the first Gears National Live Event will take place in Sydney in April.<br />
<br />
To celebrate, our Gears of War 3 Admin Midnite has organised the first Gears Online Round of 2012! February will play host to an awesome free to play tournament with some sweet prizes including $400 cash.

So thanks to the Gears fans for a tedious wait, but it is with great pleasure we announce this today. We look forward to supporting you in 2012!!  - ACL CEO: Vanz </span></span></strong><br />
<br />

<strong class='bbc'>What</strong> – Online Round 1<br />
<strong class='bbc'>When</strong> – February 10th, 11th & 12th<br />
<br />

Saturday 11th February: Pool Play Continuation + Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />
Sunday 12th February: Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />

Friday 7pm AEDT<br />
Saturday 12pm AEDT<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>What’re we playing for?</strong><br />
We’ve been working hard to secure some sweet prizes for the Gears Online Round. So far we’ve got Character DLC codes, a couple of games and most importantly $400.<br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 15px;'><span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play – Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have (tba – usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST plan ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine the next stage.<br />
<br />
Teams will go head to head on Friday the 10th and finishing on Saturday the 11th of February in a Round Robin tournament to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on both Saturday the 11th and Sunday the 12 of February.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination – Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs earlier.  Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement rounds will determine the Overall Points for your placing.<br />
<br />
Double Elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all the tiebreakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed in the DE bracket to fight it out to for the top spot and the prizes that go alongside it.<br />
Double Elimination gameplay will commence straight after the last pool play matches have been <br />
played on Saturday the 10th and will run through to Sunday the 11th of February.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/694/shadi.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Today Todd from ACL took some time out to have a chat with the winner of the latest FIFA tournament hosted on ACL, The Community Shield. Shadi the Daddi took out Australia's first online FIFA 12 tournament in a dominating fashion.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: Cheers for your time Shadi, before we get cracking tell us a bit about yourself.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span><br />
Name: Shadi<br />
Age: 25<br />
Gamertag: Shadi The Daddy<br />
State: Victoria<br />
Favourite Team: Brazil<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: How long have you been playing for FIFA for? And what got you into it?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span> I've been playing ever since the game was released. I've also played soccer since the age of 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: How did you feel competing in your first ACL competition? Did you have any nerves or any expectations?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span> I was just excited to play, it was my first tournament. I take fifa seriously, so I was really into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: I noticed that you used International teams for every game played during this competition, what was the reason behind that?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span> I feel that when somebody uses Real Madrid, Internationals are the only teams that can beat them. Plus I don’t like using club teams.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: What were your thoughts after finishing your pool play games with 8 wins and 0 losses?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span> I thought that I was going to win the whole competition. Edxpress was a really tough opponent though; I think I scored in the 90th minute to win one of my games against him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: Will you be attending any LANS in the future? What about competing in any more online competitions?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span> I’ll definitely try and attend all of the online rounds, I’ll just have to try and fit in games around my schedule. As for LANS, I’ll try my best to attend the Victorian one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: How did you find organizing your games during the week for pool play?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span> I really enjoyed the way it was done, because it meant I was able to play when I was free.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: Who did you think was your toughest opponent during this competition?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Shadi:</strong></span> I thought Edxpress was a really tough opponent because I only won each game by one goal. I also thought that you were a good opponent to play against because you managed to win a game against me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>Todd: Thanks for your time Shadi! I hope to see you competing in ACL’s first online round in the coming days!</strong></span>]]></description>

<br />
<span style='font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode'><span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Mindfreak Esports and ACL Community present a Halo Reach 'No Pro' Tournament</strong></span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Fresh off the launch of ACL Community we are pleased to announce the first ACL Community tournament of 2012! Hopey from Mindfreak Esports in conjunction with ACL Staff will run this tournament leading up to ACL Gold Coast to provide perfect practice for newer or less experienced teams to gain more valuable tournament practice to sharpen their skills for our first Nationals event of 2012.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Details</strong></span><br />
How does this tournament differ from a regular ACL Reach 4v4 tournament? Well 'Pro' teams are not allowed to compete in this tournament in order  to open up the playing field for much more even competition and give a chance for some newer and less experienced players to shine. Now Pro teams don't take offence to this rule, it simply means your skill is widely recognised in this community, and you are too good to compete <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />.<br />
Unfortunately these teams and their players are unable to compete in this tournament:<br />
-Immunity<br />
-Mindfreak<br />
-Lateral<br />
-Vox Eminor<br />
-Break Even<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Prizes</strong></span><br />
Thanks to Mindfreak Esports each member of the winning team of this tournament will win a 3 month xbox live membership.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'>*Must have a minimum of 10-15 teams registered in this tournament for teams to be eligible for prizes.</span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>When</strong></span><br />
9th of January - 14th of January<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play</strong> - 9th of January - 13th of January<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination</strong> - 14th of January<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>TIMES</strong></span><br />
9th Jaunary - 13th January - Whatever times you schedule with teams in your pool.<br />
14th January - Double Elimination tournament starts at 12pm AEDT<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Pool Play will be run from Monday January the 9th of January to Friday the 13th of January it is up to teams to organise with other teams in their pool when they will play each other. All Pool Play matches must be competed by Friday night.<br />
Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.<br />

<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>As if 2012 wasn't already action-packed here at ACL, today we are proud to announced another new aspect of competition here at ACL in the form of ACL Community! Those who have hung around the forums long enough will remember 'Weekend Warriors' back in the days of Halo 3, well think of ACL Community as a huge step up, as we really kick social gaming into gear here for 2012. ACL Community tournaments will be run over all our supported titles, as well as a multitude of other games that aren’t on our ACL Pro Circuit. This will provide you guys at home with more fun competitions throughout the year and give you a chance to play in different types of tournaments that you may never have seen before. While these tournaments may be more social and less serious then our regular tournaments, they will still be run as well and as professionally as the tournaments you are used to from ACL.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>More Details</strong></span><br />
ACL Community tournaments will be typically be run over a dedicated weekend and will be hosted twice a month by ACL Staff.<br />
These tournaments will range from titles you are familiar with being played in competitions such as Reach, MW3 and Fifa to games you may never have played in tournament environment before such as Battlefield 3, Forza, NBA and a whole lot more!<br />
ACL Community tournaments will be hosted by ACL Staff members who will provide a very structured and organised tournament while allowing you to unwind and have an enjoyable gaming session.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>This year the Australian Cyber League kicked off its 2012 Pro Circuit with a bang, introducing for the very first time ACL 'Regional' events to our Pro Circuit structure. ACL Regional events are LAN events held all around Australia for each individual flagship title for the purpose of creating more competition, building the local scene, awarding season points and giving players more chances to get invaluable LAN practice. With the introduction of Regionals how fitting it was for the first Regional events ACL held to be for Starcraft 2, the newest addition to our Pro Circuit line up. Starcraft 2 is one of the most entertaining and popular competitive titles in the world, and we have no doubt it will have a long and successful run on our Pro Circuit. Check out all the results from our first league of ACL Regionals below, and thank you to all competitors who came out and attended these events!</strong></span></span><br />

		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/banner/halo-or1-bannersmall.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The first Halo: Reach 4v4 online event of the 2012 circuit has been announced for mid December!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
The 2012 Halo Reach circuit has officially kicked off! With the announcements of our brand new 'ACL Regionals' events, mixed in with our traditionally online events, you now have more chances then ever to secure season points for a better ranking at our national tournaments. With the 2011 season just wrapped up and Immunity being announced the 2011 Halo Reach champions who has what it takes to take down the juggernauts this year? Don't miss your first opportunity to compete in an Online Round for 2012 and give yourself the best possible head start on the rest of the competition.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>What</strong></span></span><br />
The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure ranking points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual score.<br />
<br />
See the ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 1 landing page <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2012/events/halo/acl-reach-4v4-r1-landing-page' class='bbc_url' title=''><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>here</span></strong></a>.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>When</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>16th December - 18th December</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>LESS THAN 24 TEAMS - NO OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 17th December:</strong> Pool Play (for all teams)<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 18th December:</strong> Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>MORE THAN 24 TEAMS - OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 16th December: </strong>Open Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 17th December:</strong> Open Double Elim/Pro Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 18th December:</strong> Pro Double Elim<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>TIMES</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 6pm ADST</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 12pm ADST</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 12pm ADST</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.<br />

<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 17px;'>ACL Regionals for CoD: Mw3 & Halo Announced</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The Australian Cyber League is proud to kickoff its 2012 Pro Circuit with a bang! As per last night's Starcraft 2 announcement, we are pleased to announce a game changing component to the entire season structure: ACL Regionals. This basically means that ACL has now 'Gone Local' and will be orchestrating not only 4 major National Events, but over 50 local events across our flagship titles from city to city in Australia this year! <br />
<br />
To celebrate this 2012 season launch, ACL staff will be travelling the country to run events for you guys in every major city!<br />
<br />

For those new to the Australian Cyber League, there are now 3 components to our competitions and season, each awarding points for your performance in these events.<br />

<br />
- <strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Online Events:</span></strong> An open invite for all to compete online against players in Australia & NZ.<br />
<br />
- <strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>National Events:</span></strong> 4 of these in 2012.

		<title>Article: Sporting My Controller</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/WrittenbyInmaniac</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 15px;'>Sporting My Controller</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
Now here is a debate that has interested me for a while. A debate that has been around ever since Dustin "HP Darkman" Langton was the first “Pro Gamer” to be signed to MLG, or even since Johnathan “Fatal1ty” Wendel, considered to be the world’s first Pro Gamer, won his first cash prize of $4000 for coming 3rd at a Quake tournament in Dallas, Texas, back in 1999. I am of course talking about the debate: “Is Professional Gaming a real sport?”<br />
<br />
I think we must first define “sport” and therein lies the problem. There are many, many variations of the definition of words, a few of which I’m going to list that have been found through online references:<br />
<br />
“Physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively.”<br />
-www.thefreedictionary.com<br />
<br />
“An activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others.”<br />
-www.google.com<br />
<br />
“An athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.”<br />
-www.dictionary.com<br />
<br />
Now, these definitions are up to the individual to take in a literal or general sense. However, I think most will agree that a “sport”, no matter what the definition, has the following traits: A sport is a physical activity, usually competitive in nature, in which a certain level of skill is required. A sport may also involve spectators.<br />
<br />
What may be surprising to some is that gaming, on a competitive level, actually fits very well into the definition of a “sport”. It requires physical skill, such as hand-eye coordination and reflexes. It can be extremely competitive and it can also attract spectators. So it seems, by definition, professional gaming can actually be called a sport. Although, if it was as straight forward as ripping a few dictionary definitions from some websites and slapping them copy-paste style into an article, the debate wouldn’t exist, would it?<br />
<br />
A lot of the controversy and power against the argument that Pro Gaming is a sport comes from a very traditionalist point of view, however it is accepted it is a valid point. Most argue that Pro Gaming can’t be a sport because there is no “physical exertion”, one of the prerequisites to define something as a sport by many definitions.<br />
<br />
To this point however, one may simply argue that using a controller or keyboard and mouse, even to the smallest degree, is still physical exertion. Given, it is very minimal exertion, yet it is still there nonetheless. Many Pro Gamers have reported having Repetitive Stress Injuries through gaming, some even needing to consult a physiotherapist. In this sense, the physical exertion between gaming and other “accepted sports” may be very similar.<br />
<br />
Another argument many people make is that Pro Gaming can’t be a sport because they don’t train. They don’t shed blood, sweat and tears to become the peak of their sport. Contrary to this as most competitive gamers would know is that Pro Gaming actually takes a lot of training, practice and dedication. Again, traits shared with mainstream sports. Gamers could spend anywhere up to 10hrs a day practicing to become better at a game, arguably more time spent on training than any accepted sport.<br />
<br />
The next argument is about spectators and this may be one of the strongest arguments. It’s a given fact that there are more people who watch sports than play them and many argue this is one of the key reasons that gaming isn’t a sport. A father can’t take his son to a local LAN in the same way he can take him to a local Football game, right?<br />
<br />
If we take a step back and look at the progression of gaming leagues like MLG, or even here in Australia with the likes of ACL, the experience for spectators in competitive gaming is drastically improving and numbers are increasing all the time. You now pay to be a spectator at an MLG event in the same way you pay to watch a game of Football. Some may even argue, what is the difference?<br />
<br />
Gaming, just as with sport, has garnered attention from the corporate world. Professional Gamers are now sponsored for thousands of dollars just as athletes of mainstream sports are. Competitive gaming has been televised and even now is streamed to literally millions of viewers online.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have had this debate with friends and colleagues and one of the arguments I hear most is a traditionalist one: “How can gaming ever be a sport? Did your parents ever take you to a local park to watch a LAN?” My answer to this, usually accompanied by a sigh is “No.” However, maybe when I have children in the future, I may just be taking them to the local entertainment centre to watch the newest generation Walshys or Ogre Twins or Boxers or Fatal1tys.<br />
<br />
To summarise, is gaming a sport? I believe it is a debate that will continue for years to come but in the end, I believe it boils down to this: <br />
<br />
If you treat Professional Gaming <em class='bbc'>as</em> a sport, it <em class='bbc'>can be</em> a sport.]]></description>

		<title>Need For Speed: The Run Launch Event</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/need-for-speed-the-run-launch-event-r150</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6093/6340676418_79a3de80e5_z.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>The Venue</strong></span><br />
<br />
Last Thursday marked the epic launch of Need For Speed: The Run in Sydney’s Potts Point, at the luxurious Scuderia Graziani showroom. In layman’s terms: Where they sell high end sports cars and supercars like Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches. A cool venue it was indeed, pimped out with a Porsche and Lambo in the foyer, the rest of the showroom was cleared for a few other vital things required for an impressive launch: Red Bull DJ stand equipped with smoking hot DJ, Emily Scott, 14 TVs loaded up with the very cool NFS: The Run and of course beer, champagne and Red Bull!<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://images.eurogamer.net/expo/games/nfsRun.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
</span><br />
<br />
<br />
From ACL we had myself, Parker, Nuguns, Cavey, Brett, Bramble and Pandan while Psykerpath and Weasel represented DB Gaming Gear. <br />
<br />
Earlier in the day I met up with Parker, Nuguns & Bramble as I had organised a few meetings with potential sponsors for ACL to coincide with the NFS launch. I sussed out the ACL Regionals venue in Sydney, which is a cracker by the way - centrally located! - then borrowed Parker's car to zip around Sydney. After checking in to our (very) cheap room for the evening, we quickly got ready and headed for a quick bite at Bar Broadway. A few beers and potato wedges later, we were on our way to the NFS launch.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6120/6339940503_f206026af1_z.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>NFS: The Run</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Upon arrival the guy with the dreadlocks from 'The Shack' commented on how well dressed I was, to which I replied with silence. He picked up on this silence and commented : "just the reaction I was looking for, awkward silence". Following my social fail we proceeded inside to meet NFS Jiggsy - the man and legend who had set up the whole event and invited ACL members. He passed us our nametags and we moved straight inside to the bar.<br />
<br />
Soon we caught up with the others from ACL and DB Gaming Gear, and a night of networking and social chat began. Not much more can be said other than we had a great time and Need For Speed looks mint!! A blast to play, high adrenaline, action racing. Sure, it's not a sim, but that's not what we wanted - we wanted some crazy, ultra performance supercars, and that is exactly what it delivered!!<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6107/6339914407_fe54cfcfc4_z.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Porsche</strong></span><br />
<br />
Not long before we left, we decided to ask the DJ whether ties were 'in' or not at these events, as Brett and I had decided they were. The DJ suggested otherwise, as we should have been going for the 'I've finished work and want to take this damned tie off look'. Vanz & Brett - 0. Emily Scott - 1. Little did I know, until searching for images just now, that Emily Scott used to be a model. You can check out her mixes and some of her former modelling shots here:<br />

<strong class='bbc'>Emily Scott the DJ</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the ACL crew, we were lacking professional photography equipment, so have stolen as much as we can from other websites to give you an insight into the event. Thanks to Auto Cult’s fantastic write up, you can see a bunch of great pics (we've ripped) here: <a href='http://autocult.mattheweveringham.com/tag/nfs-the-run/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>http://autocult.matt...ag/nfs-the-run/</a><br />
<br />
Anyway, this marks the conclusion to this wrap-up, which can be conclusively agreed upon by all as a GREAT NIGHT! Many thanks to NFSJiggsy for the hookup and EA Australia for always looking out for ACL!!<br />

For the first time ever we will be running a PC title in Starcraft 2. Added to that, we are happy to announce a game changing component to the entire season structure: ACL Regionals. This basically means that ACL has now 'Gone Local' and will be orchestrating not only 4 major National Events, but over 50 local events across our flagship titles from city to city in Australia this year! <br />
<br />
<br />
To celebrate this 2012 season launch, ACL staff will be travelling the country to run events for you guys in every major city. Announcements for more of ACL Pro Circuit titles will follow in coming days, but this one is all about the beginning of something big with Starcraft 2.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
For those new to the Australian Cyber League, there are 3 components to our competitions and season, each awarding points for your performance in these events.<br />
<br />
<br />
- <span class='bbc_underline'>ACL Regionals:</span> As announced, an open invite to compete for season points in each city.<br />
<br />
- <span class='bbc_underline'>Online Events:</span> An open invite for all to compete online against players in Australia & NZ.<br />
<br />
- <span class='bbc_underline'>National Events:</span> 4 of these in 2012. The first has been announced as <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/topic/14850-acl-gold-coast-announced' class='bbc_url' title=''>ACL Gold Coast - Info here.</a> These have the biggest attendance & biggest prizes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>How the circuit will work in brief:</strong><br />
<br />
You will earn points for every placing you receive within the top 32 at each event you compete in during 2012. Each component of the competition has a varying weighting of points distribution.<br />
<br />
The National events for Starcraft 2 are Invite Only. Invitations will be sent out based on your season points.<br />
<br />
Everyone in each capital city will have 2 chances to accrue season points before the first national event. 1 x Qualifier (ACL Regionals event) and 1 x Online Round before ACL Gold Coast in January 21-22.<br />

		<title>ACL 2011 Circuit Official Wrap-Up</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/FullwrapupofACL39s2011circuit.</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i987.photobucket.com/albums/ae359/inmaniac1/ACL2011Review.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
Wow... What a year! That is what most of us are saying after the end of the 2011 ACL National Circuit, and what a year it has been! It’s hard to believe it’s already time for us to wrap everything up on what has surely been ACL’s most successful year to date. It has been a year of monumental growth in our community, with attendance levels and stream numbers rising with every event. All of ACL’s supported titles, Halo Reach, Call of Duty Black Ops and FIFA 11, along with “the fighters” Super Street Fighter IV, Marvel v Capcom 3 and Super Smash Brother Brawl & Melee, all had exciting and close competition for the year.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'>Although small in numbers, the most passionate players by far were to be found in FIFA11.</em></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.gameguru.in/img/fifa-11-01.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'>Written by Peteh</em></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Melbourne</strong></span><br />
Marking the season opener and FIFA’s first appearance as an official ACL title, Melbourne was a fierce competition for those gunning to secure a top spot on ACL’s FIFA ladder. With Online Round 1 champion Muzza a no show due to competing in the Fifa Interactive World Cup, punters looked towards the likes of Brett, Cripsy and Todd to contest for the number one. Pool play ended as expected with Brett sweeping his pool and Cripsy coming out on top as well. The bracket, however, was another story.<br />
<br />
Brett tore through Darkspawn and Brandz on the way to the Winners Bracket Final, while dark horse Somedude overcame favorite Todd in an exciting 3 game series before beating Cripsy to face Brett. Brett defeated Somedude and lay waiting for his next opponent in the Championship Match. The Loser’s bracket is where the story starts though as Cripsy defeated Trazza in Losers Bracket Round 2 and then dominated Todd, setting up a rematch against Somedude.<br />
<br />
Cripsy made no mistake this time around, Somedude was put to the sword in two games without notably threatening Cripsy’s defense. The fairytale run had reached the final and did not fail to impress. Cripsy took out game 1 in a close fashion before Brett replied by shutting out game 2. It all came down to game 3. Cripsy was reduced to ten men late in normal time with the scores at 2-2 before smashing home a winner against the play in extra time.<br />
<br />
A great run through the Loser’s bracket marked this tournament a huge one for Cripsy and if the smack talk between Cripsy and Brett was any indicator, it also marked the start of a rivalry for the rest of the 2011 season.<br />
<br />

<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>Hooters interviews ACL Melbourne Champion, Cripsy</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Sydney</strong></span><br />
Sydney was the biggest tournament for FIFA on the 2011 circuit, gamers from all over dropping in to compete for the top place. It would be Muzza’s first event after missing Melbourne but taking out Online Round 2 left him in good stead. Mark "Skip 1" Azzi was also to make an appearance hot off placing 3rd in the Fifa Interactive World Cup. These two, combined with the ACL regulars shrouded the number 1 spot with mystery.<br />
<br />
Muzza made a statement in pool play by destroying Cripsy on mainstage and Skip made a similar impression in his pool. Newcomer Humpty shocked some more experienced players by topping his pool in an impressive fashion. These three as well as Cripsy continued to impress in bracket play. Muzza took out King and Brett before ousting Cripsy to reach the Winners Bracket Final and Skip defeated Trazza and Bman before ending Humpty’s hot streak.<br />
<br />
The WBF was a true clash of the titans as both Muzza and Skip were uncontested so far in the competition. A 2-0 series win by Skip gave the fixture little justice as Muzza was closely ousted in both games to drop into the Loser’s Bracket. Humpty didn’t let his defeat in the Winner’s bracket curb his impressive countering style as he took out Brett and Cripsy on his way to the Losers Bracket Final. Muzza took out the first game 1-0 before Humpty replied impressively by running circles around Muzza’s defense. Muzza rallied in game 3 to take out the series and set up a much anticipated rematch against Skip.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/uploads/1310276117/med_gallery_18_625852.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>Skip and Muzza playing out the Winners Bracket Final at ACL Sydney</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
The final started slowly with each competitor taking a game, the decider really opened up in the 85th minute when Skip took the lead. Showing a lot of character, Muzza scored possibly the goal of the season considering the circumstances when he completed a triangle play featuring a back heel to equalize in the 90th minute. The match went into extra time where Muzza went ahead on the 105th minute before Skip equalised minutes later. That wasn't the end though as Muzza rallied once again and scored in the dying moments of the game to close out Skip and the Sydney competition.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Brisbane</strong></span><br />
The finals event was one that featured possibly the strongest lineup of players, the guard from Sydney minus Cripsy and Humpty was attending with the addition of Maverick, Spurs and Peteh. Skip was back to get revenge on Muzza who had recently won Online Round 3 and was looking to complete his perfect tournament record.<br />
<br />
Skip impressed in pool play to take out top seed, but Muzza fell early to Peteh before rallying for third seed. Spurs silenced the haters by coming out of pool play with the fourth seed. In double elimination, Skip took out Maverick and Todd as expected to reach the Winners Bracket Final, on the other side of the bracket Brett took down Muzza before being defeated by Lakey who was on fire with Real Madrid.<br />
<br />
Skip snuffed out Lakey’s run in the Winner’s bracket with ease to advance to the Championship match, Lakey was left to wait for the Loser’s bracket to play out for his next match. As a trend, Muzza demolished the Loser’s bracket, wiping the floor with Peteh in vengeance before taking down Todd and Brett on his way to Lakey. Lakey’s first appearance in the finals at a LAN event was marred by the fury that was Muzza, conceding 10 goals in two games on his way to third place.<br />
<br />
The master class met yet again in the final, a rematch of the Sydney finals and LBR2 in Online R3 was on the cards for the 2011 National Championship. Muzza never slowed down from his Losers Bracket run and took out the first game 1-0 with a fine Ronaldo header. Inspired by the first win, Muzza never looked back and took out Skip impressively in the second game to become ACL’s first FIFA National Champion, winning every ACL tournament he played in 2011.<br />

After winning ACL Online Rounds 1, 2 and 3 as well as ACL Sydney, the Brisbane Finals was the jewel on Muzza's crown of success in 2011. On several occasions showing strong character to dig through the Losers Bracket, the mark of a true National Champion.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'>Written by Nephix</em></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Melbourne</strong></span><br />
With Melbourne being the first stop for the 2011 circuit and with the brand spanking new Black Ops on the market, teams were eager to make their mark in ACL Call of Duty history, all rearing to take out the first event of the season. With new teams in the mix such as Cruelty Incarnate, a resident GameBattle's team turned LAN team after impressive online performances as well as the ACL regulars such as Frenetic Array and Malice. Ego's were flaring and the trash talk was starting as teams boasted about their recent placings in ACL Online Round 1 as well as previous titles such as the 2010 National Champs. With pride on the line and the hype to see how the newer teams fared, the stage was set for Melbourne to kick the LAN circuit off with a bang!<br />
<br />
Despite losing to the 2010 national champs (Frenetic Array) in the early stages of the event, the newly formed Cruelty Incarnate took center stage as they showed their might coming back from previous defeat to take out the champs in the Grand Final. It was a truly inspiring comeback showing that even when your down, teamwork and communication can get you over the line. Oh and having a decent shot doesn't go astray either!<br />
<br />
While they weren't always in the spotlight, teams such as Five Down, Emperor and Taunted also made a name for themselves showcasing the up and coming talent the 2011 season had to offer. They didn't disappoint either, placing a respectable 3rd to 5th respectively, with some great showings of spawn traps and g33k nades all round. <br />
<br />
Cruelty Incarnate's Naked showed his talent being named MVP of the event with a graceful display of Mp5K skills and unique rush style of gameplay unknown to many of the 4's teams at the time. But what is a player without his team? Helping to bring home the victory were his teammates Insanity, StenGunz & team captain Vilesyder. <br />
<br />

<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>Melbourne MVP - Naked</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
After knocking off the heavy favorites to win (Frenetic Array), Cruelty Incarnate were looking like strong contenders ready to take on the rest of the 2011 season and why wouldn't they? A team formed days before the event had just knocked off the 2010 national champions!!<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Sydney</strong></span><br />
Ahh Sydney, Melbourne's team pool has just been put to shame. Although less teams turned up to Sydney, the ones that did come were regarded as the best of the best for Black Ops competitive 4's. With teams returning such as Frenetic Array, Cruelty Incarnate, Emperor and Taunted the tournament looked hard enough to win. Then MindFreak decided to gate crash the party. Being one of the best 5v5 Search & Destroy teams around and one of the most respected teams in the league, Sydney was looking to be massive.<br />
<br />
With blood in the water after multiple team changes and shock departures by a few players, the hype surrounding Sydney could only grow. None more so than the online feud between the new Frenetic Array lineup and the boys from MindFreak. Both teams able to take a game of the other at a moments notice and both hungry for victory after all the t-talk and ego explosions on the forums prior to ACL Sydney.<br />
<br />
Fresh off their win in Black Ops Online Round 2, Frenetic Array were looking sharp with their new lineup consisting of their captain Buzzin, Geemon, Renzy & Trent. The boys looked in great form not dropping a series in pool play seeding them first for the double elimination to come. Hot on their trail was their rivals MindFreak placing second in hot pursuit not allowing Fray to run off with the title of ACL Sydney champs.<br />
<br />
After some grueling double elimination, the stage was set with fan favorites Frenetic Array facing off against their arch nemesis MindFreak. It was a real life clash of the titans about to go down on the main stage. After a thrilling series MindFreak eventually managed to sneak in a lead and pushed on full steam ahead guaranteeing the win and sealing Frenetic Arrays fate. All was not lost for the Fray boys as the National's were just around the corner in the form of ACL Brisbane.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/uploads/1310279170/med_gallery_19_614383.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>2011 ACL Sydney Champions: Mindfreak.Razor - Rapture, Zeeq, Naked, Kritikal</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_underline'>Brisbane</span></strong><br />
After what has been an up and down years for Call of Duty teams abroad, the finals were here and the best of the best had flown in from all corners of Australia chasing the title of the 2011 Call of Duty Black Ops National Champions. With attendance picking up from Sydney's event, Brisbane was set to be the toughest competition to date with big hitters MindFreak and Frenetic Array returning to bring the pain.<br />
<br />
Picking up where they left off at Sydney, Frenetic Array returned with its all-star lineup and the addition of their core 4th member StenGunz back into the team gave them the confidence boost they needed to bounce back from their defeat at ACL Sydney. Not deterred by their loss in ACL Black Ops Online Round 3 to the hands of Taunted, this re-vamped lineup had their game faces on from the word go.<br />
<br />
After breezing through pool play only really having one close encounter to a freshly pruned Cruelty Incarnate, Frenetic Array secured their first place seeding for the double elimination. Coming in close contention was MindFreak taking the second seed and Cruelty Incarnate following closely in third. Meanwhile the recent winners of Online Round 3 found themselves having difficulty without their star player.<br />
<br />
Moving through the double elimination, Frenetic Array went undefeated into the Grand Final cementing their shot at the national championship. After being knocked into the losers bracket by Cruelty Incarnate, MindFreak were slowly working their way back up the ranks to once again face off in another epic finale. Unfortunately for the boys they were knocked out and send home with a third place finish overall after running into the dark horses known as Cruelty Incarnate. The series was arguably the best out of all the events with both teams conjuring up amazing comebacks to take games off each other with Cruelty managing to seal the deal.<br />
<br />
Finally the time had come for the energizer bunnies Cruelty Incarnate to take on the aimbots that were Frenetic Array in a continuation series of their previous match-up with Fray heading into the series with a 3-2 lead. In the end after 10/11 games played in the series, the scores were as follows 6-3-1 (Win-Loss-Tie) to Fray and 3-6-1 for Cruelty who put up one hell of a fight against the unstoppable force that has become, Frenetic Array.<br />

<em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>xMsl interviews Frenetic Array before the Championship Match</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
Two previous runner-up placings from Frenetic Array led to relief as much as celebration when they finally took out ACL's National Championship and their first LAN victory in 2011. Very impressive for a team who's ex-fourth came back from a lengthy hiatus two days before the tournament.<br />

<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Melbourne</strong></span><br />
Melbourne was the first stop of ACL’s 2011 circuit and the first official LAN debut of the Halo Reach 4v4 competition. With a new game came new challengers and 15 of the finest teams in Australia came to duke it out to win ACL’s first ever Halo Reach 4v4 LAN event. The teams were, as a whole, a bit of a mix and match of seasoned veterans and new up-and-comers.  Reigning 2010 champions and MLG attendees Team Immunity were also back to show their dominance in the latest Halo title and they did not disappoint.<br />
<br />
Without dropping a single game in the double elimination bracket, Team Immunity went on to win the competition with a 6-0 victory over the then-named Frenetic Array. However, this second place finish for Fray and their line up of Hopey, Haunted, Monk and Dark would only be the start of a very successful year for these players.<br />
<br />
The rest of the competition was by no means overshadowed, with the likes of New Era, X&Y, Outbreak, Sworn Oath, Initial Concept and Original Gangsters all placing 3rd-8th respectively in what was a hard-fought and exciting competition. Substance Abuse would place 9th, a consistent placing that would stick through the rest of the year. <br />
<br />
Team Immunity’s Benno was once again the FFA Champ, however, it wasn’t a title that would stick with him for long in 2011. Highlights of the event would have to be X&Y’s win over Sworn Oath in the Winners Bracket Quarter-Final and Fray’s 3-0 win over New Era in the Losers Bracket Finals. This competition would be the  spark for a huge season of Halo that lay ahead.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Sydney</strong></span><br />
Fury. It was a team that no one had heard of until they snatched the #1 seed out from under Team Immunity’s nose. A shock to everyone, Fury dominated in their pool play match ups, however, their magical run wouldn’t last once they hit the double elimination bracket. There they met the best of the 20 teams that attended ACL Sydney. Teams like X&Y, Break Even and New Era, names that are synonymous with top-level competitive Halo were in the mix.<br />
<br />
Once double-elimination started, it was déjà vu as Immunity fought their way to another victory in the ACL circuit, making it 2/2 for the year so far. However, no excitement was to be found in the winner, rather the place-getters. Distinctive, now known as Vox Eminor shocked many to beat long-standing Halo team Break Even for the 2nd spot. New Era, Initial Concept, Death Eaters, Fury and X&Y would then follow 4th-8th respectively. The most exciting series of Sydney, by far, was that of Distinctive vs Fury in the Winners Bracket Quarter Final. With Fury 2-0 up in the series, Distinctive came back with a landslide 3-2 victory – this series is my pick for series of the year.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>ACL Sydney Runners-up: Team Distinctive - Haze, Mantis, Halvo, Crux</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
As for the FFA, long-standing 9 event champion Benno was knocked off his perch by none other than his own teammate Voltage in a thrilling FFA final that saw Pulse get a surprising 2nd place with Benno following in 3rd. <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Brisbane</strong></span><br />
After the thrilling competition that was seen at ACL’s Melbourne and Sydney events, everyone was excited to see what competition lay ahead at ACL’s Brisbane Finals event. With a near record breaking attendance of 21 teams the ACL Finals event would definitely not disappoint.<br />
<br />
Coming into the finals there were some major players going in to make a name for themselves and contend for the top spot. As expected, Team Immunity were back to try and claim their 3rd consecutive championship but not without the newly sponsored Mindfreak Razer, Vox Eminor and Break Even squads trying to stop them. Big names with well practiced players were in with a fighting chance and the competition that unfolded was fierce.<br />
<br />
Hopey led his team Mindfreak Razer to an impressive second place finish, cementing their place as one of the top Halo Reach teams. This was no small feat, beating Break Even in the Losers Bracket Final. The throw-together team of Deano, Shockz, Lunar and Mitchy would see BOSS clinch the 4th spot away from VoxE, New Era and Infamous.<br />
<br />
The most impressive team, however, would be none other than the 2011 Halo Reach champions, Team Immunity. Their line up with new 4th Ogre1, played all the way through and won the competition without dropping a single game, a feat that had never before been achieved at an ACL event. Team Immunity, Australia’s own “God-Squad”, proved why they were #1.<br />

<br />
In 2011, ACL has shown what potential the Australian gaming community really has and our plans for 2012 will shatter all preconceived opinions of what level Australian gaming can achieve. The leaps and bounds ACL took in 2011 will carry on into 2012, with ACL taking on hot new locations such as our first official LAN stop on the Gold Coast, along with adding the highly-anticipated PC title Starcraft II to the official circuit. Get ready for 2012 to blow you away.<br />
<br />
We at ACL would like to take this opportunity to thank our players, members, supporters and fans. Without you guys, this organisation wouldn't be where it is today, on the forefront of Australian competitive gaming. We hope you enjoy being a part of this organisation as much as we do, and we look forward to being with you in 2012 and well into the future.<br />

<br />
Never have I been more motivated to work towards the future of Australian gaming. AusHalo ’09 was the event that started it all. A competition that was fresh, bold and exciting, it was groundbreaking in Australia and no gaming event even came close until the Melbourne and Sydney stops of ACL’s 2011 circuit. That was, until the EB Games Expo.<br />
<br />
This event was to gaming what Woodstock was to music. It opened my eyes to the world of commercialised gaming and showed me what “mainstream” actually meant. In the world of gaming, a few well-known brands and companies spring to mind. Xbox, Sony, Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Activision, BioWare, 343 industries, Bethesda, Ubisoft and the list goes on. Out of all of these companies, there was not one that wasn’t represented at the EB Expo. Not one.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you now have a grasp of how big this event actually was. The event saw over 16,000 people attend over two days and I must say, it was a very nice feeling to be surrounded by so many like minded people. These people, who have the same passion and drive for gaming, who spend their hard earned money to come to this Expo, if you leave out the fact that I was working then you might say I was in a gamer’s heaven.<br />
<br />
What I really loved about this event wasn’t just the awesome stands or give-aways, it wasn’t the perks that came with my job, it wasn’t even seeing the very attractive lady cos-playing Tifa from Final Fantasy. No, it was the reminder that came with this Expo, the reminder that gaming is very much alive and so very much on the rise. Any doubt in my mind about the future of ACL was at that moment, washed away forever.<br />
<br />
You see, as a member of staff in ACL and one of the founding members of what is to be “ACL House”, I would be lying if I said I didn’t have my doubts or that I wasn’t a little worried. I think it’s natural. We all make sacrifices and for some of us, change our habits, lives or even the state we live in, just to see the best for the future of ACL and Australian Gaming as a whole. We didn’t see exponential growth in LAN attendance nor did we see servers crash from too many people watching our stream, however, there were very noticeable and marked changes to our organisation and I think that has changed many things for the positive. We’ve seen increases in our numbers and the quality of our content. EB Expo however, has pushed me over the line.<br />
<br />
We all talk about what we want for the future, what we are planning for and how we are going to do it. This is all great and we all want it but it was simply fantastic to see those kinds of numbers at a gaming event. Granted, they weren’t all into ACL’s supported titles and they may not all be into competitive gaming, it does however give me the hope and drive for the future, It shows me that they may not be on ACL yet and they may not be watching our tournaments on our stream, but the gamers are there.<br />
<br />
Countless times while working on the Halo: Anniversary booth was I approached by enthusiastic people, of all ages, races, male or female, who all wanted to “kick each other’s butts”. It brought a smile to my face, but not as much as two young lads, no older than 10, who came into the booth on Saturday morning. I overheard one of them, as he finished killing his mate in Halo, say, very excitedly, “I wish there was a competition at this, I’d beat everyone!”. When I walked up to him, I said “Did you know there actually is? I help to run that competition.” He then continued to tell me how he’d be the best at it. If you punched me in the face or hurt a small puppy, you still wouldn’t be able to wipe the smile off my face after that brief conversation.<br />
<br />
I look forward to a day where an ACL event will be as much of a drawcard for gamers as EB Expo was. It was such an impressive event and showcased the best of Australian gaming. I am sure that with the support of our current member base along with the dedication and enthusiasm of staff and volunteers, we can make ACL into an organisation that thousands will call the home of Australian gaming, long into the future. Here’s to 2012.]]></description>

		<title>ACL Brisbane Halo: Reach 4v4 Wrap Up</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-brisbane-halo-reach-4v4-wrap-up-r135</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://aclpro.com.au/tournament/stream-banners/reach-winner.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
The Halo: Reach 4v4 competition here at ACL Brisbane has now come to an end and to no one’s surprise, Team Immunity have once again come up on top, doing so undefeated.<br />
<br />
With a new look squad, now featuring Ogre 1 instead of Slayer, Team Immunity have proven once again that they are still the undisputed top team in Halo: Reach in Australia.<br />
<br />
Throughout the early rounds of double elimination, the top teams such as BreakEven, Vox Eminor, Mindfreak.Razer and BOSS progressed steadily through their segments of the bracket. <br />
<br />
The first big meeting of the top teams occurred in Winners Bracket Round 3, when BOSS came up against, Immunity. As expected, Immunity defeated BOSS 3-0, however this was by no means an easy win. Later, Voltage would speak of how impressed he was by the ability of BOSS, especially considering that the line-up had only come together in such a short period of time.<br />
<br />
With BOSS now down in the losers bracket, Mindfreak would face New Era in Winners Bracket Round 4. Despite some close games, Mindfreak would ultimately prove the stronger team, winning the series 3-1, whilst Immunity made swift work of Vox Eminor, 3-0.<br />
<br />
With the Losers Bracket now populated by many of the top teams, all focus was on the match-up between New Era and BOSS. Despite being the first of the top teams being sent to the losers bracket, BOSS came out firing and never looked back, downing New Era in a dominating 3-0 fashion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Vox Eminor would face Break Even in one of the most intense series of the weekend. Whilst many expected Vox Eminor to defeat the Break Even squad, based simply upon experience, a well as the impressive performance they put on at ACL Sydney, it came as a real shock when Break Even came through to win 3-2. Vox Eminor were now out of the tournament, finishing a disappointing 5th.<br />
<br />
Break Even would now face BOSS in the Losers Bracket semifinal, with many expecting the sheer experience of the Break Even squad to easily outweigh that of the recently formed BOSS squad. Expectations were swiftly proved wrong, however, with the series going back and forth, and ultimately ending up at 2-2 before going in to a decisive game 5. Fortunately for Break Even, game 5 was Team Slayer on The Pit, which would ultimately favour them due to the wealth of experience the team has had on the same map in Halo 3. BOSS never really provided much of a threat in this game, and ultimately shut the series out 3-2, advancing to the Losers Bracket Finals.<br />
<br />
Having been clean swept 3-0 by Immunity, Mindfreak.Razer now found themselves in the Losers Bracket Finals, up against BreakEven. Keen to make up for their mistakes against Immunity, Mindfreak.Razer came out with all guns blazing and never looked back, making quick work of BOSS and sending them out of the competition with an amicable 4th place finish.<br />
<br />
The scene was set for the Grand Final, with Immunity going up against Mindfreak.Razer in a continuation of their previous series. Continuing their dominant fashion, Immunity turned on the afterburners, instantly removing any chance of a comeback, taking out the entire tournament without dropping a single game.<br />
<br />
The title of National Champions is the third event in a row for Heff and Voltage, the 2nd for Benno, and the first for new star recruit, Ogre 1.<br />
<br />
Over all, ACL Brisbane has been a fantastic success, with an incredible turn out, intense games, and great viewer numbers watching the stream.<br />
<br />
From all of us at ACL, we thank you for your fantastic support in 2011, and can’t wait to see you in 2012 for the biggest and best ACL Pro Circuit yet!]]></description>

		<title>ACL Brisbane Halo: Reach Pool Play Wrap Up</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-brisbane-halo-reach-pool-play-wrap-up-r134</link>

<br />
Halo: Reach 4v4 pool play has just finished up here at ACL Brisbane, with the seeds now set for the double elimination bracket, scheduled to kick off tonight.<br />
<br />
Going into pool play, the teams to look out for were undoubtedly Razer Mindfreak, Vox Eminor, New Era, Break Even and the recently reshuffled defending champions, Team Immunity, featuring previous MLG National Champion, Ogre 1. <br />
<br />
Playing the recently updated MLG v6 settings, games got underway a little after 10am.<br />
<br />
In Pool A and Pool B, both New Era and Mindfreak.Razer swept through their respective pools without dropping a game, further warranting their titles as some of the best teams in Australia.<br />
<br />
Pool C featured the recently sponsored Vox Eminor squad, looking to continue on from their impressive second placing at the last ACL Pro Circuit event in Sydney. They wasted no time in proving their skills, as they went through their pool without dropping a game against teams such as Substance Abuse and infamous.<br />
<br />
Pool  D was undeniably the strongest pool in the tournament, consisting of the top seeded Team Immunity, BreakEven, and recently formed Team Boss. Whilst there were no surprises when Immunity made it through without losing a game, the series that most were interested in watching was Boss vs BreakEven. Boss, a recently formed team made up of former Halo 3 players Shockz and Mitchy, along with Deano and montage king Lunar went into the series as favourites in the eyes of many. Unfortunately for them they failed to live up to the expectations of the crowd and were bungled out in three straight games.<br />
<br />
With these results all in the can, the pool have now been set for the double elimination bracket to begin, scheduled to kick off later tonight.<br />

		<title>ACL New Zealand Postponed</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-new-zealand-postponed-r124</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><strong class='bbc'>ACL New Zealand Important Announcement	</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
On August 25th we announced ACL’s very first New Zealand Event for December 2011. <br />
<br />
This event has been the hot topic of the past week and we regret to inform you all that we are postponing this event.<br />
<br />
It had come to our attention that the timing of this event wasn’t the best for the community and we decided it would be best to push it back.<br />
<br />

		<title>Team Immunity recruits an Ogre</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/team-immunity-recruits-an-ogre-r126</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.team-immunity.com/jesse/haloreach.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'>Team Immunity would like to announce an important update to their Halo line-up that has been representing Team Immunity over the year at many large competitions both nationally and internationally. Isaac ‘Slayer’ Turkovic will be stepping down from the line-up, and world renowned ex-Team 3d player Daniel ‘OGRE_1’ Ryan will be taking his place.<br />
<br />
Daniel made a name for himself over the course of Halo 2 and 3 for Team3D; he has become one of the most recognised gamers in the Halo competitive scene. Daniel has recently moved to Australia and will be bringing plenty of experience and talent to the Team Immunity Halo line-up. The addition of Daniel to the Team Immunity line-up is a greatly welcomed enhancement to the already strong team.<br />
<br />
On joining Team Immunity Daniel commented, <br />
<br />
‘<em class='bbc'>This has opened a door for me to get back into the competitive Halo scene, both on a national and international level, with a team and organisation that is motivated and whom I respect</em>.’<br />
<br />
Isaac steps down from his position, after being an integral part of the success Team Immunity has experienced over the year. Some of the great competitions he was involved with were the Australian Cyber League tournament, which is the largest Halo competition in Australia, and also at the Anaheim leg of Major League Gaming in the United States, which is the largest Halo competition in the world.<br />
<br />
Team Immunity has a reputation for professionalism and top-tier player skill as seen throughout their performances, demeanour and practice routines. Daniel is a tried and tested eSports personality, who will add a wealth of ability and professionalism to the team. In regards to what he wants to achieve with Team Immunity, Daniel comments, “<em class='bbc'>I always expect great things of myself; I am looking to strength the team with structure and experience, so we can achieve greater things in the future.</em>”<br />
<br />
Team Immunity General Manager Lloyd ‘Swordfish’ Smith had this to say,<br />
<br />
‘<em class='bbc'>It’s sad to see Isaac go, he has been a huge asset to the organisation in his short time here and we wish him the best in the future. In saying that, we’re very happy to be bringing Daniel into the roster - being such a recognised and experienced player that he is and can’t wait to see the newly established roster compete!</em>’<br />
<br />
With this line-up update Team Immunity will look to improve upon the standard they already have set for future tournaments both at home, here in Australia, and overseas.<br />
<br />

		<title>ACL Reach 4v4 Online R3 Wrap Up</title>

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>ACL online events have always been a valuable part of the ACL Pro Circuit and provide the perfect balance between a fun weekend of gaming and a competitive tournament environment for the best players in ACL. Online competitions serve the purpose of providing players with valuable points to seed them in future LAN and online tournaments, accommodate players and teams that are unable to attend LANs, and constantly test who is the best team in Australia and New Zealand.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 3 has just passed and featured 27 of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand battling for 1st place over September 2nd-4th. As per regular tournament segregation open pool play kicked off on the Friday Night of September 2nd and featured 19 teams fighting it out for valuable seeding ranks and the opportunity to progress the open double elimination tournament the next day.<br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Friday</strong></span></span><br />
The open pool play competition was spread out amongst 4 pools (3 pools of 5 and 1 pool of 4) and each pool provided some close fought and impressive competition. In pool A we had Fifth Degree, a team made up of players spread out all over Australia and ACL semi-pro Slazy take out their pool with an impressive 9-0 win loss ratio, going through their pool without dropping a game. In pool B we saw the biggest upset of the open pool play tournament in Take Aim consisting of some new and old blood (Hoggy, Oh Mitchy, Medler, Slam Dawg) take out their pool going undefeated after meeting up with Open Pool Play favourites Endure and narrowly taking them down 2-1. In Pool C we saw New Zealand team of Lord of the Rings and Team Guido's both go through pool C without dropping a game until they met up with each other in the last round where 'Lord of the Rings' took out the series 2-1, giving them the highest seed from Pool C. Last but not least Pool D saw another skilled New Zealand team in Team Chimera take out their pool only dropping one game to Pure Resistance, giving them the highest win/loss ratio and the pool win. When all open pool play battle had finished the seeding process had provided the top 16 best teams with seeding ranks for the next day open double elimination bracket, those seeding ranks are listed below:<br />
<br />
1.) Fifth Degree<br />
2.) Team Chimera<br />
3.) Lord of the Rings<br />
4.) Take Aim<br />
5.) Endure<br />
6.) Pure Resistance<br />
7.) Team Guido's<br />
8.) EnVious<br />
9.) Inertia<br />
10.) Team Chronic<br />
11.) Apathy<br />
12.) Authentic<br />
13.) Narcotic<br />
14.) Stat-us Whore<br />
15.) The Demonic Anarchy<br />
16.) Impulse Gaming <br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Saturday</strong></span></span><br />
Next up was the competition on Saturday, which meant the open double elimination tournament and pro pool play. In the open double elimination we saw the above seeded teams facing off against each other in a standard double elimination format: 1v16, 2v15, 3v14, 4v13, 5v12, 6v11, 7v10, 8v9. In winners bracket round 1 the results were fairly typical with all games going in favour of the higher seed. From there half the talent dropped down to begin their fight through the losers bracket while the winning teams progressed through the winners bracket. Envious, Team Guido's and Lord of the Rings were all looking strong taking out their winners bracket round 2 matches 3-0, though when Endure and Take Aim met up for the second time in the tournament so far the match up went to a nail-biting 5 game series where yet again Take Aim emerged victorious taking the series 3-2. In winners bracket round 3 we saw Take Aim match up against Envious and Lord of the Rings match up against Team Guido's, from here Lord of the Rings proved they were too much for Team Guido's beating them 3-0 while Take Aim managed to take down Envious 3-2 in yet another close seires. This set up the winners bracket finals of the open double elimination tournament where Take Aim yet again displayed their ability to clutch best of 5 series taking down Lord of the Rings 3-2 in a very close fought match up. Battling out of the losers bracket however was Team Chimera, they managed to come back all the way from losers bracket round 2 to the losers bracket finals where they were scheduled to play off against Lord of the Rings, however due to the fact that Lord of the Rings members had to jump offline they forfeited the series to Team Chimera.  Unfortunately for Take Aim who were waiting in the Finals this also happened to their team, as as all their members weren't online to play they also had to forfeit the series to Team Chimer which awarded Team Chimera number 1 seed from the open double elimination bracket.<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The seeds from the open double elimination bracket are below:</strong></span><br />
<br />
1.) Team Chimera <br />

<br />
While all the open double bracket elimination action was being played pro pool play was also going down where the Top 8 ranked teams going into ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round all played off against each other to determine seeding ranks for the pro double elimination series on Sunday. Two of the strongest teams in pro pool play, Mindfreak.RAZER and Team Sidewinder, met up against each other right off the bat of the competition and ended with the result of 2-1 to Mindfreak.RAZER. This ended up being the only game Mindfreak.RAZER dropped in Pro Pool Play with them going on to win 20 games with only 1 loss. <br />

<span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Sunday</strong></span></span><br />
Sunday marked the final day of competition in the pro double elimination tournament. All the pro ranked teams were to match up against all the open teams who progressed from the open double elimination for an epic bracket boasting the best teams in ACL. As the bracket progressed we quickly saw teams such as Mindfreak.RAZER, VoxE, iNFamous, Team Sidewinder, New Era and Break Even all taking out their winners round 1 matches easily with a quick 3-0. However we saw the open double elimination winners Team Chimera give Substance Abuse a real run for their money, narrowly losing the series 2-3, and in the match up of Initial Concept verses Take Aim we actually saw Take Aim upset Initial Concept 3-2.  In the winners bracket round 2 we saw Mindfreak.Razer run past Substance Abuse 3-0, Team Sidewinder take down Take Aim 3-0, iNFamous upset Vox Eminor 3-1 and Break Even beat New Era 3-1. In the winners bracket semi-finals we saw Mindfreak.RAZER once again show their dominance 3-0'ing iNFamous and Team Sidewinder showing why they are a top team knocking Break Even down to the losers bracket after beating them 3-1. This set up the winners bracket final match up between Team Sidewinder and Mindfreak.RAZER, and while many thought Mindfreak would just breeze past TSW like they had been doing all tournament TSW pulled off the biggest upset of the competition taking down Mindfreak and knocking them into the losers bracket.  In the losers bracket we saw Team Chimera fight their way from losers round 1 to be the only open bracket team to place in the top 8, beating Initial Concept 3-2 in placement to place 7th. In losers bracket round 4 we saw Vox Eminor 3-0 Break Even and New Era 3-0 iNFamous, which put them both in the losers bracket semi-finals. New Era seemed to have caught fire by this point in the losers bracket and managed to take out Vox Eminor 3-0.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>Game 3 CTF Element from Vibe's POV.</strong></span><br />
<br />
It was now down between Mindfreak.RAZER and New Era to see who would meet Team Sidewinder in the finals. Mindfreak.RAZER came out strong taking game 1, although unfortunately it seemed all down hill from their for Mindfreak as New Era took the next two games straight and in the fourth game Royalfan lagged out really sealing the nail in their coffin, meaning New Era progressed to the Finals after taking down Mindfreak.RAZER 3-1.<br />
<br />
New Era had a very long road a head of them in the finals. As Team Sidewinder had come into the finals undefeated it meant that New Era had to beat them twice, a feat which they did not seemed intimidated by. The finals were a long and gruelling series, New Era managed to take out the first series 3-2, meaning they had to beat Team Sidewinder again to win the tournament. The finals now turned into a best of 11 series, and the games seemed to go back and forth with each team taking a turn a winning a game. <br />

		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/articleimages/haloreachor3-610x200.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The third and final Halo: Reach 4v4 online event of the 2011 circuit has been announced for early September!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
With ACL Sydney just gone and less than two months till the ACL BrisLAN finals event this is your last chance to earn valuable circuit points which will help to improve your seed for the 2011 season! This tournament is crucial for those teams who were unable to attend ACL Sydney and don't want to lag behind the competition in the rankings. Don't miss your last opportunity to compete in in Online Round for the 2011 season and show the community what you are capable of!<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>What</strong></span></span><br />
The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure ranking points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual score.<br />
<br />
See the ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 3 landing page <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2011/events/halo/acl-reach-4v4-r3-landing-page' class='bbc_url' title=''><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>here</span></strong></a>.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>When</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>2nd September-4th September</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>LESS THAN 24 TEAMS - NO OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 3rd September:</strong> Pool Play (for all teams)<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 4th September:</strong> Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>MORE THAN 24 TEAMS - OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 2nd September: </strong>Open Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 3rd September:</strong> Open Double Elim/Pro Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 4th September:</strong> Pro Double Elim<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>TIMES</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 6pm AEST</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 12pm AEST</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 12pm AEST</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.<br />

<strong class='bbc'>The following was added and changed:</strong><br />
<br />

<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Registration:</strong></span><br />
ACL has introduced a simpler and easier way for all competitors to register for events in our brand new form registration system (thanks to Cavey and Direct). You must fill out ALL boxes and specify who is captain and remember if you ever need to change your registration details you can go back to the form and just change the details - your previous information will be there for you to change! <br />
<br />
To register for this event go to the registration form <a href='http://registration.aclpro.com.au/?e=19' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>here</span></strong></a>. <br />
Once you have completed the registration form you will see you or your team signed up <strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'><a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2011/events/sydney/sydney-rego' class='bbc_url' title=''>here</a></span></strong>.<br />
<br />
Confirmation is now live for this event, to confirm yourself or your team please revisit the registration form <a href='http://registration.aclpro.com.au/?e=19' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>here</span></strong></a> and press confirm!<br />

<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Food & Drinks:</strong></span><br />

		<title>Immunity Wins ACL Sydney Halo: Reach 4v4</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/immunity-wins-acl-sydney-halo-reach-4v4-r103</link>

<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>In a dominating fashion, Team Immunity took the ACL Sydney Halo: Reach 4v4 finals</strong></span><br />
<br />
The question on everyone's mind going into the ACL Sydney LAN was whether or not Immunity's pick up of ex-team mate Slayer was the right choice. With only weeks of practice in Halo: Reach from Halo 3, would he perform under pressure? Any doubt was silenced as the weekend progressed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/articleimages/im-article-2.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
Immunity started strong on Saturday only dropping one game in a Pool Play tie breaker against Fury. The rest of their opponents copped a thrashing in the form of quick 3-0 flag games and slayer steaktaculars.<br />
<br />
During Saturday, Voltage of Immunity showed off his practised gameplay and won the Halo: Reach FFA.<br />
<br />
On Sunday, Immunity made quick work of all opponents. A surprise team came out of nowhere; Distinctive, their first time attending a LAN as a team. They met in the Winner's Finals. Unfortunately, Distinctive's momentum could not shut down a practised Immunity squad and was sent to the Loser's Bracket with a 3-0.<br />
<br />
After Distinctive arguably upset Halo 3 superstars Break Even, the finals were set. Immunity v Distinctive.<br />
<br />
In an incredible display of team work, communication and consistency Immunity 3-0'd Distinctive yet again winning the ACL Sydney Halo: Reach 4v4 6-0.<br />
<br />

		<title>Reach 4v4 Pool Play Wrap Up</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/reach-4v4-pool-play-wrap-up-r99</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/tournament/stream-banners/now-playing-reach.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
The first day of Halo: Reach competition has come and gone here at ACL Sydney with several upsets already taking place in the early stages of pool-play.<br />
<br />
With Voltage taking out the FFA tournament early in the day, all attention turned to the main event, the 4v4. Whilst many were expecting team such as Team Immunity and New Era to finish on top, many questions still surrounded the middle-tier teams.<br />
<br />
The initial shock came in the very first round of pool play, when Initial Concept (Jim, Tranquility, Stryfe and Jayce) knocked off New Era (Vibe, Fade, Blaze, Natural Talent) with a score of 2-1. After play had finished in that pool, New Era and Initial Concept would both finish with a 77% win success rate.<br />
<br />
Another interesting result came in Pool B, with 8 Max (Nuguns, King Arrow, Satiex and Bramble) knocking over KGo (Blocks, Msl, Deci, S5 Unit) with a 3-0 sweep, quite a surprise to many considering that several members in the 8 Max squad have voiced several times that they rarely, if ever play Halo: Reach.<br />
<br />
In Pool C, the much-favoured Death Eaters (Hopey, Chantelle, Dark and Karloo) cruised through without dropping a game, whereas former ACL Pro Halo 3 player Adz wasn’t experiencing the same luck, as his crew of Super Best Friends (Strider, Petephile, Parkerino and Adz) only managed to win two games throughout all of pool play.<br />
<br />
Pool D saw some heavy competition in the likes of X&Y (Toddles, RoyalFan, Pulse and Blood Weapon) and No Remorse (Omen, Fearless, Killself and Godlike). No Remorse, a team consisting of several past players with very little experience, have performed very well, notching up a 77% win ratio. On an interesting note, when the two teams met each other, No Remorse came away with the chocolates, coming out 2-1 victors.<br />
<br />
No surprises were to be had in Pool E, with Team Fury (Monk, Demon, Asikk and Cheez) coming out without dropping a game, receiving very few challenges from any of the others teams in their pool. The biggest surprise was held for the end of pool play, when Team Immunity and Team Fury were to face off against each other to determine who would take the first seed heading into Double Elimination.<br />
<br />
In a one-off game of Element Team Slayer, Team Immunity kicked off to a quick lead, and looked to secure their much expected first seed. However, in a late-game charge, Team Fury came from behind to take the match 50-47, along with the first-seed. <br />
<br />
Following pool play the placing would read as follows:<br />
<br />
1.	Team Fury<br />
2.	Team Immunity<br />
3.	Death Eaters<br />
4.	New Era<br />
5.	Initial Concept<br />
6.	No Remorse<br />
7.	X&Y<br />
8.	Distinctive<br />
9.	Break Even<br />
10.	Infamous<br />
<br />
With pool play only in its infancy, it will be interesting to see if Team Fury’s first seed was simply a fluke, or if they can back it up with a solid performance throughout Double Elimination. With MLG Anaheim looming in the distance, will Team Immunity be able to prove that they are still the best team in Australia? And what about all of the middle-tier teams mentioned earlier?<br />
<br />
ACL Sydney has been the most unpredictable event so far and there’s sure to be even more surprises in store tomorrow. Make sure you tune in to www.aclpro.com.au to see which team is crowned ACL]]></description>

<br />
The winner of the official ACL MLG Raffle has been announced, and the lucky winner is Brad Bell (Gamertag: Bradlllzzz)!<br />
<br />
Drawn in front of the entire crowd at ACL Sydney, ACL Director Nick Vanzetti drew Brad’s name from a bucket of 114 ping pong balls to declare him the winner.<br />
<br />
Brad will travel to Anaheim, California with ACL admins Vanzo, Beware and Hoggy, along with the boys from Team Immunity.<br />
<br />
Brad said he couldn’t believe his luck, and can’t wait to attend MLG Anaheim.<br />
<br />
“I’m so shocked but extremely excited for the chance to go over there and watch an event,” he said.<br />
<br />
“I used to live in San Francisco so it’ll be great to get back over there.”<br />
<br />
MLG Anaheim is the first event that Team Immunity will attend since they placed a very respectable 17th at MLG Columbus last year.]]></description>

		<title>FIFA Pool Play Results Wrap Up</title>

<br />
Pool play for FIFA 11 has just concluded with several notable players jumping out to the front, going through undefeated.<br />
<br />
With the biggest turnout for a FIFA game that we have seen yet, Muzza, Skip and Humpty have all emerged from pool play without dropping a game.<br />
<br />
Finishing with a differential of +33 goals, Muzza is statistically the best in the field. That being said, Skip, fresh off his 3rd place finish at the FIFA Interactive World Cup in Los Angeles, finished with a differential of +33 goals.<br />
<br />
Having competed against the best players in the world, Skip noted that the talent at ACL Sydney is incredibly impressive<br />
<br />
“I’ve been to state championships and qualifiers for several years now, and I’ve never seen so many quality players in the one room together as I have seen today,” Skip noted.<br />
<br />
“Players like Brett, Cripsy and Muzza are all great competitors. There’s a lot of pressure on me playing here after my performance at the FIFA Interactive World Cup and I’m definitely feeling it.”<br />
<br />
ACL Melbourne champion Cripsy is currently sitting in equal 4th after pool play, with a +13 goal differential.<br />
<br />

		<title>Voltage Wins ACL Sydney FFA!</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/voltage-wins-acl-sydney-ffa-r96</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/tournament/stream-banners/voltage-wins-ffa.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
The Reach Free For All is over here at ACL Sydney, with Voltage from Team Immunity emerging victorious.<br />
<br />
Breaking a 4 event hoodoo held by team-mate Benno, Voltage emerged just four kills clear of his nearest rival, Pulse, to claim the title.<br />
<br />
Solid grenades and some lucky triple kills were enough to get Voltage over the line for his first ever FFA victory.<br />
<br />
"I just held top middle as much as I could and worked to get grenades on the ramps as much as possible," said Voltage.<br />
<br />
"It feels good, and I feel like my individual game has improved really considerably since Melbourne".<br />
<br />
Voltage will travel with the rest of Team Immunity to compete at MLG Anaheim later this month to compete at Major League Gaming. <br />
<br />
"We’ve been practicing a lot and we’re feeling really confident," he said.<br />
<br />
"Nothing is set in stone yet but we’re looking at having a pre-LAN with Ninja’s team (which includes Walshy and Best Man)."<br />
<br />
Other notable performers in the FFA include young up-and-comers Cheez and Jayce, both posting respectable scores.<br />
<br />
With FFA now out of the way, the Halo: Reach 4v4 is scheduled to soon get underway. Stay tuned to www.aclpro.com.au for more info.<br />

		<title>ACL Sydney Kicks Off!</title>

<br />
A little behind schedule yet just as excited as ever, Vanzo gave his introduction to ACL Sydney, one of the biggest events in ACL Pro’s history. Never have we seen such a great turnout, only comparable to the great AusHalo LAN ’09. With 18 confirmed Halo Reach teams showing, a 40+ attendance in the Reach FFA and nearly a 100% attendance rating from the rest of ACL’s titles, it truly is a massive event.<br />
<br />
With Pool Play under way for Halo Reach, CoD Black Ops and FIFA, along with all of our MvC3, SS4, Smash Bros Brawl and Melee action, expect to see some surprising results soon. Who will shine and go strong into the Double Elimination Bracket, and who will take out the Reach FFA?]]></description>

		<title>Muzza Wins ACL Sydney FIFA 11</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/muzza-wins-acl-sydney-fifa-11-r101</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/tournament/stream-banners/fifa-results.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
FIFA 11 has provided one of the most exciting and controversial series that we’ve ever seen on the ACL Pro Circuit.<br />
<br />
After emerging from pool play as the top two players, Muzza and Skip would ultimately meet in the Grand Final to play in a best of 3 series.<br />
With both players taking a game each, it would head to a final and decisive third came to decide the winner of ACL Sydney.<br />
<br />
With both players stuck at nil all heading into the final stages, it was Skip who would strike first  in roughly the 84th minute to take a 1-0 lead with only roughly a minute to go. Muzza, not to be outdone, would reply almost instantaneously, with a clever flick pass into the centre of the box, which he capitalised on to tie the scores at 1-1 in the 89th minute.<br />
<br />
With all scores tied up, the players would head into extra time to determine the winner. After a slow start to begin with, Muzza managed a clever cross into the waiting head of Drogba, who slotted it into the back of the net. Usually this would result in play continuing for the remainder of extra time, however the two players had accidentally selected for a winner to be determined via ‘Golden Goal’, and the game ended.<br />
<br />
After much deliberation, it was decided that a replay would occur with neither player making a move until the 25th minute mark. At that point, Skip would concede an own goal, and play would commence for the remainder of the half. This was chosen because FIFA 11 works with a very complex “Momentum Engine” which makes the players play better when they’re confidence is high.<br />
<br />
Skip, however, proved momentum was no factor in the game, answering back almost immediately to keep his chances of victory still alive.<br />
<br />
With only about 30 seconds remaining in this makeshift second half of over time, Muzza proved he was difficult to rattle, and a clever cross followed up by a brilliant strike would put the ball in the back of the net, leaving Skip without any time to mount another serious offence. Thus, Muzza was declared the winner of ACL Sydney for FIFA 11.<br />
<br />
Speaking to Hooters and Brett after the game, Muzza noted that the pressure and intensity of the final series was unlike anything he’d ever experienced before. After experiencing a lot of success in our online FIFA rounds, he noted that he’d most definitely caught the LAN bug, and that we’d be seeing him at ACL Brisbane later on this year.<br />
<br />
A huge amount of credit must also be given to Skip. For those unaware, his platform of choice for FIFA 11 is the PlayStation 3, which is of a faster pace compared to the Xbox 360 version. His ability to transfer to a new platform and still make it to the finals is a testament to his natural talent at the game.<br />
FIFA is proving time and time again that it is one of the most exciting games on the circuit, and ACL Sydney was no exception. Be sure to look out for more FIFA 11 action through both our ACL FIFA Online Rounds, as well as our at our final event for 2011, ACL Brisbane in October.<br />

		<title>Halo: Reach 4v4 Bracket Update</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/halo-reach-4v4-bracket-update-r100</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/tournament/stream-banners/bracket-update-1.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
The Double Elimination bracket is well underway for Halo: Reach here at ACL Sydney, with several notable results already recorded.<br />
<br />
In Round 2 of Double Elimination, we saw Team Distinctive (Crux. Mantis, Halvo and Haze) sending Break Even down to the losers bracket much earlier than anticipated with a 3-1 victory. Break Even, who entered the tournament with a large amount of optimism after solid pre-LAN results, were fairly disappointed, having tasted a lot of success as a team in Halo 3.<br />
<br />
Continuing the trend of upsets in Double Elimination of Round 2, New Era (Vibe, Fade, Blaze, Natural Talent), who finished in 3rd place at ACL Melbourne, were bundled down to the losers bracket by  Initial Concept (Jim, Tranquility, Stryfe and Jayce). Adding to the shock of this result was the fact that this Initial Concept result was put together rather late, with Jayce joining only weeks before the event began.<br />
<br />
No Remorse (Fearless, Omen, Killself and Godlike) surprised many  by claiming the 6th seed in the Double Elimination bracket, however their shock run was hindered somewhat by a 3-0 loss to Death Eaters (Hopey, Chantelle, Dark and Karloo).<br />
<br />
New Era, after falling shockingly to the losers bracket late yesterday are still in the mix after defeating Infamous 3-0.<br />
<br />
The real story of today has just come from Winners Bracket Round 3 which took place on the ACL Sydney Mainstage between the previously mentioned Team Distinctive and top-seeded Team Fury (Asikk, Cheez, Monk and Demon). Having toppled the much-favoured Team Immunity in pool play yesterday, few thought Team Fury would have many issues in making it through the Winners Bracket Round 4. Distinctive, however, had other plans.<br />
<br />
With Team Fury racing off to a quick 2-0 game lead in the series, it looked like we’d be witnessing a comprehensive shutout. Not to be embarrassed, Team Distinctive would rally in Game 3 to take Zealot Bomb 2-1 in a very dominating fashion.<br />
<br />
As a strong crowd began to build in front of the ACL Mainstage, the nerves were behinning to show in the Team Fury camp. Distinctive would take a 4-1 lead into the final game. Some strong objective running from Monk would result in a flag throw to Cheez to take the score to 4-2, with Monk then securing the Active Camo to nab his team a third capture. However it was too little too late for Team Fury, as the clock would prove to be their main enemy, running out of regulation time.<br />
<br />
 It would all come down to a final and deciding game on Countdown Team Slayer. Nothing could separate the teams at all for the entire game, with no team jumping ahead by anything more than six kills. The real different maker in the game would be Halvo’s use of the Active Camo, as he secured the final one to grant Distinctive top control and send them through to the next round with a 50-45 victory, sending the crowd into a frenzy.]]></description>

		<title>Tt.GIGA pick up FIFA 2011 player - BreTt</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/ttgiga-pick-up-fifa-2011-player-brett-r102</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span style='color: #000000'><span class='bbc_center'>-Article originally written by Mayo-</span></span><br />
<br />
Hey all,<br />
<br />
I am excited to announce that we have recently recruited Brett “BreTt” Newton for our FIFA 2011 (console) section. Formerly known as ninjabrett, he has already achieved awesome results during the last couple of months, placing 2nd, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the three competitions run by the Australian Cyber League (ACL). Not only that, he has also secured his position for the Australian World Championship Gaming (WCG) national finals, after securing his ticket at the recent WCG Sydney qualifiers. <br />
Just recently, Brett also participated at the ACL Sydney LAN, where he was unfortunately knocked down from the finals.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Up-coming competitions:</strong><br />
- ACL finals at Brisbane in early October<br />
- WCG national finals in mid-October, having secured his ticket at the WCG Sydney qualifiers.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, BreTt can secure a spot for the WCG and represent Australia for FIFA 2011 while he is participating and achieving excellent results at LANs and tournaments. We are looking forward to BreTt’s achievements, not only for himself but for Tt.GIGA as an organisation.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Quick info;</strong><br />
Real name: Brett Newton<br />
Tag: Tt.GIGA BreTt aka ninjabrett <br />
Game: FIFA 2011<br />

<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The Australian Cyber League (ACL) today announced a partnership with consumer electronics manufacturer Soniq which will see the ACL main-stage decked out with two Full HD LCD screens to showcase all of the action taking place on the premiere stage for Australian competitive gaming.</strong></span></span><br />

<br />
Director of ACL, Nick Vanzetti, said the news of this partnership is a great way to keep event participants glued to the action of the main-stage.<br />
<br />
“ACL events are just as much about competing as they are about spectating. Through this partnership with Soniq, we’re bringing all of the great action to our live audiences in crystal clear format,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Through the addition of main stage LCD screens, we’re now able to showcase more action simultaneously than ever before.”<br />

<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Tell us how long you have all been playing games, and what was the first title or console that got you hooked on gaming?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> I've been playing games since I was so young, starting off with the old Nintendo, been hooked ever since.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> I've been gaming since I was a kid, but the Xbox 360 and Halo 3 got me hooked onto gaming.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> I've been gaming my whole life since Sega Saturn.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: How did you guys first find out about ACL?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> My brother used to play H2 with some of the old school kids, like Nitros, and I went to a FFA LAN in my area for the release of the 360 and watched some of the best players in Australia play Halo 2 and just started playing Halo hard out since then.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> I found out about ACL through Shano early 09' which is when I played my first online competition then kept going from there.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> Well I've been playing competitive Halo since Halo 2 with Friction and when I started playing Halo 3 I think he met a few guys here and he told me to join.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Looking back on ACL Melbourne, Monk and Demon were the only members from your team to attend that event. What did you guys think of the event? And Asikk and Cheez, how come you guys weren’t in attendance?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> Well I didn't have a team and didn't want to go to a LAN without a team.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> Being my first LAN event. I had so much fun playing on LAN for once and finally meeting people I've been speaking to for years. Saying that Sydney is going to be better, I'm pumped.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> I didn't have a team and I guess I'm too young to travel alone. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: This Fury lineup formed after ACL Melbourne and in the lead up to ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2. Can you tell us a bit about how this team formed? And what each player on the team brings to the table?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> Well fury has been around for ages, it was called hit list in H3, but we were pretty bad. Cheez and I have been teaming ever since. Demon was pretty new to the Halo scene and we didn't even really consider teaming with him until New Era took him under their wing and he just became such a better player, and we knew he would be a good asset to the team. I have been good friends with Monk for a while and when he split up with Unite we had to snatch him up.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> Amped/Unite disbanded after Melbourne. I was planning on quitting gaming but I knew Fury didn't have a 4th for R2 so I decided to play with them for R2. I was then planning to quit after R2 but I became good friends with the Fury boys and now playing with them for Sydney. What I bring to the table to the team is that I just do anything that needs to be done, I don't have a set role. But I'm the one that goes over films with them and explains what we are doing wrong and how to improve. <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> I've been teaming with Asikk since H3 and after Melbourne there were a few FA's and I think Asikk asked Monk to join and Demon had to beg us to get in and what I bring to the table is making Asikk stop playing objective and learning how to playing MLG.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: In ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 you guys finished 4th and were the second highest placing Australian team in the tournament. What lead to such a strong performance during this tournament?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> We played pretty horrible on the Saturday due to me having no sleep the night before because I had been clubbing in the city for my mates 18th. On the Sunday however we just got our head in the game and did our best.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> In pool play we played bad since there were two slayers and one objective game. But in the pro bracket it's the other way around. I guess we just all performed well and got the placing of 4th.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong>In pool play we were just playing really bad and raging at each other but on the Sunday we just played how we are supposed too.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Let's talk about the 5 game series between Initial Concept for Top 4. You guys were 2-0 down and came back to win the series 3-2. What was going through your heads during that series? How were you able to turn it around?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> Well, as Tranquility said in his timeout those last 3 gametypes were some on iC's weakest and they just happened to be our strongest, and I guess we just played better on the day.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> Honestly I didn't even know that we were 2 games down and they only needed to win one more game to knock us out. So that being said my mental game was still focused. Some of our good gametypes at Game 3 and after were all being played so that gave us an advantage. Just after taking that first game making it 2-1 must of gone into their head and we just carried on from there. Their dual-host was insanely bad for me so once we got into game 5 each time they choked or played bad I t-bagged them and beatdown their corpse to get into their head. Haha it seemed to have worked. When we won I actually went mental and ran out the house into the backyard and basically attacked my dog, then ran around the backyard then came back inside after like 5 mins. I was also half naked doing this.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> I think we just kept our cool and didn't think what the score was and were good at those gametypes.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: On to ACL Sydney, I believe you guys are already at the same house in preparation for the event? Is this mainly for some side-by-side practice leading up to the LAN or just a chance for you guys to hang out and have some fun?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> Well me and Pete are at Cheez's house now, its a shame that demon had to leave due to work.. But we still are getting some decent practice in with 3 of us here. The main point for us coming to Cheez's house was to LAN and get some practice, but we ended up getting along really well and are having a heaps mad time together.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> This is mainly to get some good practice in before the Sydney event. From day 1 Cheez was too focused on looking at his teammates screen way to much, which starting making him play bad. So we already fixed that and now we know he won't have that problem at the event. This is why I wanted to do this, playing on tri/quad-host is also fun haha. We also have been hanging out as well. Cheez only lives minutes away from the beach and I finally went to a 7/11 store for the first time! It was awesome, but I forgot to buy a slurpey...which was the main reason why I wanted to go haha.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> A bit of both but its really good for practice and for Monk how to show me how not to get goosed. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Leading up to Melbourne predictions are quite varied, many of many especially concerning how Fury will perform. With such a strong performance in R2, and probably one of the best practiced teams going into the event how do you guys see yourselves placing?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> I'm pretty confident with my team, but I know we have so much more potential, I guess it depends how much we practise and how hard we practise, and how we play on the day but I'm hoping for a decent placing.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> I've been flicking through the forums lately and some players have been predicting us quite high. I don't know where they are getting these predictions from though. I feel were still not playing as good as we should be yet, so in the next couple of days we're going to game hardcore. But at the same time a lot of people are predicting us below top 6. Just to let people know, we have a confirmed preLAN with bE on Friday. So that's going to be a lot of fun. We'll be sure to post results on ACL for everyone to know.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> I think we might get top four but there are some scary teams out there<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: No Remorse has of just recently expressed last minute interest of attending ACL Sydney with the line up of Omen, Fearless, Kself + an unconfirmed 4th. Almost in the same boat is Break Even, widely recognised as the second best Halo 3 team in Australia. Both of these teams are coming into the event with minimal practise, but due to their experience have a lot more teamwork and intelligence about the game than some of our newer and more practiced teams. How do you see these guys placing at ACL Sydney? Do you think their Halo 3 skills and knowledge will carry over to Halo Reach at the event?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> bE will place well I think, and beat most practised teams just because of their previous history together, + with a 19 game series with iM and pre lanning us all day Friday they will have some great practise. Nr should beat most teams.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> I was excited when they made a thread about nR coming to Sydney. I'm very curious to see how they will perform. I know Kself is a boss and he'll do good at Sydney. I can't remember who but either Omen or Fearless have been gaming with iM a couple of weeks ago. bE just did a 19 game series with iM last night, so at least they finally got some practice in. But I'm going to say bE top 4-5, but I have no idea with nR since they don't have a confirmed 4th yet.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> I think we'll beat nR but bE hopefully there'll be some close games, I aint scared .<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF8C00'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: With all the diverse teams coming into ACL Sydney it sure is making it a hard event to predict. However, I am asking for all your top 8 predictions. I want clear predictions, not any of this 4th/5th or 2nd/3rd nonsense, a decisive top 8 please!</strong></span><br />

<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Asikk:</span></strong> Yea I'll do bad, no snipe for me to stat with in the FFA<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Monk:</span></strong> Haha, I'm bad a FFA's. I don't really even like them. There are a lot more players coming into this event and a lot of them are high skilled so this FFA is going to have much different placings this time around. I see myself in top 8 hopefully but I want to see how Brad from bE performs in this FFA... and my Hopey of course.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Cheez:</span></strong> I don't know probably top 8?<br />

		<title>Timeout with Tranquility</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/TimeOut_Tranq.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>Today Beware from ACL sits down with Tranqulity from Team Initial Concept. Tranquility has had some impressive placements so far in the 2011 ACL Pro Circuit and is looking to improve upon them come ACL Sydney. Today we get his thoughts going into ACL Sydney and discuss Initial Concepts recent lineup change.</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Thanks for sitting down with me Tranquillity, can you start off by telling us a bit of information about yourself?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Name:</strong></span> Steve<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Gamertag:</strong></span>  iC Tranquility<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>State:</strong></span> QLD<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Current Team:</strong></span> Initial Concept<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Favourite Gametype:</strong></span> Warlock TS/CTF, Sanctuary Bomb<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Controller settings:</strong></span> 7 Sensitivity, Recon, No Vibration.<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hobbies:</strong></span> Gaming, relaxing and enjoying life.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Tell us a bit about your gaming background and how you originally found out about ACL?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span> Well I’ve been playing video games my whole life, and always wanted to eventually play games at events and stuff.  Two years ago I got an Xbox after finding out about MLG, then proceeded to try and find somewhere in Australia that does the same.  I posted on the Bungie forums and someone sent me to Aushalo.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Tell us a little bit about your previous Halo experience since you starting competing in ACL tournaments?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span> I hadn’t really played Halo much aside from going to friend’s houses.  I started playing around September 2009, got to know a few people online and ended up teaming with Tosh, Darkspawn and Bahoo.  However broke up with them a few days before Melbourne LAN in 2010 and placed 7th with Jim, Shifty and Icevayne.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Looking back on ACL Melbourne, Initial Concept placed seven. Not a bad placement in any regards, but you boys seemed to be disappointed with it. What went wrong that event? What stopped iC from placing higher?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  Honestly I believe I had a lot to do with us losing against Game.  We were up 2-1 in the series and after narrowly losing Game 4 on Element CTF I became frustrated and played terrible in the final game.  Also Darkspawn was always very busy which limited our time to practise as a whole team,  along with Jim’s net dying a lot.  Me dropping from 7 sensitivity to 3 for the event didn’t help either.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: After Melbourne iC made a team change, and you guys picked up Chantelle in place of Darkspawn. What was the reason for this team change and what lead to the decision of picking up Chantelle? </strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  Well Darkspawn never played much as I said before, and after Melbourne he told us he didn’t have the time to play and quit Halo completely.  We looked around for a while afterwards and Jim was talking with Chantelle, she seemed pretty keen and we picked her up.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Going into ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 you guys still had Chantelle and seemed confident to do well. After Pro Pool Play iC had third seed going into the Pro Double Elimination tournament on Sunday were you ultimately placed 6th (breaking your 7th place curse <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />). Tell us about that placement, where you guys as a team happy with your performance and your 6th place finish?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  We were feeling really confident all tournament long.  We lost a few games in pool play due to my internet cutting out near the end of games, but most games we won we did pretty solid.  The next day we won our first series against TSW and 4G and were feeling great but got 3-0’d by VX.  Loser’s Bracket was definitely disappointing for us, we lost our series against Fury after being up 2-0.  However breaking the 7th curse was a great feeling.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Not many may know but Initial Concept came extremely close to securing a top 4 finish. In your series against Fury for Top 4, and then your placement series against Category 5 for 5th iC was up 2-0 in both series only for both teams to come back and beat you guys 3-2. What happened in these series? What stopped you guys from being able to close out those wins?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  We got outplayed.  The two game types we seemed to lose the most, the bomb game types, were both game 3’s and we never seemed to be able to even get the bomb into their base.  It seemed that this killed our momentum and lost us both series.  <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Leading up to ACL Sydney the Initial Concept line up almost seemed set in stone,  then less than two weeks out from the event Chantelle left the team. What happened to cause this? And how did it affect your team?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  Even though we placed well in R2, we never seemed to have that chemistry with Chantelle that the rest of us have with each other.  She has a much more passive play style than the rest of us and it just didn’t seem to work and we felt like we lost a lot of games due to this, especially bomb where you need to be very aggressive to get the bomb into the other teams base.  I think she felt like it wasn’t working as well and left to join Hopey and Dark’s team.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: So for ACL Sydney your lineup is now Tranquility, Jim, Stryfe and Jayce. Is Jayce a permanent member of iC, or just on iC for this event? How does playing with Jayce compare to playing with Chantelle?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  We played a few games last night and it already feels like we have much better chemistry than we did with Chantelle.  Jayce has a lot of slaying power and he’s much more aggressive which blends well with our playstyle.  I feel if we keep practising we’ll soon know whether he’s the 4th we’ve been looking for, it’s looking good so far.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Many members seem to be making some very generic predictions coming into ACL Sydney. Understandable due to the recent horde of team changes and the unexpected results in ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2, but what are your clear top 8 predictions for ACL Sydney?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  I feel the difference between teams right now is so small that there are a lot of teams that can compete for 2-6.  <br />
<br />
1. Immunity<br />
2. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE<br />
3. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE<br />
4. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE<br />
5. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE<br />
6. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE<br />
7. Distinctive/Fury<br />
8. Distinctive/Fury<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Of course alongside the 4v4 Reach event at ACL Sydney there will be the Reach FFA tournament. You came out very dominant at ACL Melbourne placing third, and then 4th in ACL FFA Reach Online Round 2. Do you consider yourself a strong FFA player? And what aspects of your playstyle from 4v4 carry over to FFA?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  I’m kind of amazed I did so well in both FFA’s because I’m not a big fan of them and always considered myself a terrible FFA player.  I think the reason I did so well is because I have a solid DMR and I’m pretty good at surviving and cleaning up one shots.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Give us a rough prediction on what you think the results of the FFA tournament at ACL Sydney will be? Which players are you expecting to see in the Finals?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  I’d have to say someone from  Immunity will win, most likely Benno.  They’re all so much more individually skilled than most players that I’d be surprised if we didn’t see at least two of them in the finals.  I’d also throw Hopey in there since he’s definitely one of the most skilled players in Australia at the moment.  Aside from that it’s anyone’s guess who ends up in the finals since there’s so many good players.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: MLG v5 gametypes and setting are rumoured to be released quite shortly. Judging on what you have seen or played in the v5 test settings what do you like and dislike about v5? What would you love to see added in v5?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  I haven’t had much of a chance to play v5.  Honestly the only thing I’d love to see in v5 is the return of game types like Oddball and  KOTH.  I feel that only playing Flag, Slayer and Bomb game types all the time can get kind of boring and I hate that they took out Oddball and KOTH just because of spectators at MLG events.  I can’t see them improving the game types much more without them.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Thanks for your time Tranquility! Before I let you go however I have to ask: are the rumours true? Is Lunar actually better than you like he claims?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  I think we’ll settle that once and for all next time we meet at a LAN.  Come at me Lunar.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Haha got any shoutouts?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Tranquility:</strong></span>  Deano, &lt;3 you.  The rest of iC for being awesome teammates, and my parents for driving me to every LAN for the past year and a half.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Sweet! Goodluck to you and Initial Concept at ACL Sydney!</strong></span>]]></description>

		<title>Halo Reach 4v4 Online Round Two</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/halo-reach-4v4-online-round-two-r73</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/articleimages/Reach4v4R2.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>The second Halo: Reach 4v4 online event of the 2011 circuit has been announced for early June!</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Sharpen those Designated Marksman Rifles, polish those Sniper Rifle scopes, ACL Halo Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 is here! With ACL Melbourne just gone and a few months till the next ACL LAN event this is a great chance to earn valuable circuit points which will help to improve your seed for the 2011 season! This tournament is crucial for those teams who were unable to attend ACL Melbourne and don't want to lag behind the competition all year in the rankings. A solid performance here may be enough to bump you up to the Pro bracket, meaning you will avoid having to fight your way out of the Open bracket for the rest of the year.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>What</strong></span></span><br />
The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure ranking points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual score.<br />
<br />
See the ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 landing page <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2011/events/halo/acl-reach-4v4-r2-landing-page' class='bbc_url' title=''><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>here</span></strong></a>.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>When</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>10th June-12th June</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>LESS THAN 24 TEAMS - NO OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 10th June:</strong> Pool Play (for all teams)<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 11th June:</strong> Double Elimination Bracket (for the top 16 teams from Pool Play)<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>MORE THAN 24 TEAMS - OPEN/PRO SEGREGATION</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 10th June: </strong>Open Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 11th June:</strong> Open Double Elim/Pro Pool Play<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 12th June:</strong> Pro Double Elim<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>TIMES</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday 7pm AEST</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday 12pm AEST</strong> <br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday 12pm AEST</strong> (If necessary) <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'>Structure</strong></span></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pool Play - Best of 3 Series</strong><br />
Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.<br />
Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.<br />
There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series</strong><br />
Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.<br />

<span style='font-family: Palatino Linotype'><span style='color: #0000FF'><span style='font-size: 17px;'><strong class='bbc'>SHADOWLOO PRESENTS: Shadowloo Showdown 2011 - June 25th & 26th</strong></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA:</strong></span> Shadowloo Showdown is back for 2011 and if you think Shadowloo Showdown couldn't get any better, you are very mistaken. Taking place at the CQ Hotel in the heart of Melbourne, Shadowloo Showdown 2011 will play host to the best players from around Australia taking on the best the world has to offer from Japan, Taiwan, United States, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and many more in a fight for cash, prizes, glory, pride and to become heroes of their nation!<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #708090'><strong class='bbc'>Special Guests List:</strong></span> <a href='http://shadowlooshowdown.com/players' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>http://shadowlooshowdown.com/players</a><br />
<br />
Shadowloo Showdown 2011 is a two day fighting game event unlike any seen before in Australia. The world will be watching via LIVE stream as these warriors duke it out in major titles such as; Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition (360), Marvel vs Capcom 3 (360), Tekken 6 (PS3), Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike (Arcade) and BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II. Winning is not everything though, many gamers will be there as spectators and to be a part of history in the making. Nothing beats the excitement of watching high level action to the roars of the crowd. <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5047/5262972667_44b4c39dd2.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
Players will also be able to socialize and improve their skills in the casual and tournament areas where gamers of all skill levels are welcome. Shadowloo Showdown 2011 will be held on June 25th-26th in the events room at the CQ Melbourne; 113 Queen St, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>2011 GAMES</strong></span><br />
<br />
The main event this year will be SUPER STREET FIGHTER IV: ARCADE EDITION and will feature a 1v1 tournament, the always fun and exciting 3v3 tournament and plenty of tense exhibition matches such as the annual MELBOURNE vs SYDNEY and AUSTRALIA vs THE WORLD. SSFIV:AE will be played on the Xbox 360 console. Reigning champion; TTC|GamerBee from Taiwan will be making a return to defend his title.<br />
<br />
MARVEL vs CAPCOM 3 will be making it's debut at a Shadowloo event this year and everyone is out to become the first Shadowloo MvC3 champion! We will also be seeing plenty of MvC3 exhibitions such as the MELBOURNE vs QUEENSLAND. Queensland players consider themselves as the premium Marvel players here in Australia, so plenty will be watching to see whether Queensland can talk the talk. MvC3 will be played on the Xbox 360 console.<br />
<br />
Joining SSFIV:AE and MvC3 in the 2D department is BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II which will be played on the Playstation 3 console and Street Fighter III: 3rd Stirke which will be played on BlastCity arcade cabinets. TTC|Tokido from Japan who took out both BB:CS and SFIII:3s last Shadowloo Showdown will be return to try and win these tournaments for a second year running.<br />
<br />
Tekken 6 will be returning to Shadowloo Showdown for another year to cover the 3D fighters department. Unlike last Shadowloo Showdown though, Tekken 6 will be played on the Playstation 3 console instead of an arcade cabinet. Can TTC|Tokido take out T6 again, or will someone step up and take the crown?..<br />

		<title>apeX-esports pick up Cripsy</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/apex-esports-pick-up-cripsy-r81</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.apex-esports.de/upload/squads/image/apexesports-fifa-team-xbox_636.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Today ACL is proud to announce European organisation <a href='http://www.apex-esports.de/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>apeX-esports</a> as the sponsor of reigning ACL FIFA champion, Cripsy.</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
Cripsy has been around the Australian competitive gaming scene for the past three years, where he helped launch FIFA as one of Australian Cyber League's competitive titles. His competitive Fifa 11 achievements include winning the exhibition event at the 2010 ACL National Championships in Brisbane, and more recently took out the championship at ACL Melbourne against some of the Australia's best FIFA players.<br />
<br />
Cripsy said that the sponsorship is a great indication of the growing prominence of ACL.<br />
<br />
"<em class='bbc'>It's fantastic news not just personally but for the growth of ACL and apeX</em>" Cripsy reports. <br />
<br />
"<em class='bbc'>I hope to see more of these sponsorships for Australian FIFA players in the near future, creating an even more competitive environment for the top-end players. I would say to all competitive gamers especially FIFA players in the ACL community to get your name out there</em>.<br />
<br />
"<em class='bbc'>I'd like to thank apeX-eSports for taking me on board their fantastic team, hopefully I can continue to raise their profile as one of the best teams in the world. I'd also like to say a quick thank you to the ACL staff who work tirelessly to make each event, both LAN and online, run so well. I'd also like to acknowledge the ever-growing FIFA community at ACL, as well as the rest of the community for supporting ACL FIFA at events, on the live stream and the forums.</em>"<br />
<br />
The next ACL event for FIFA is FIFA 11 Online Round 2 and the next ACL LAN event which will hold some of the best FIFA players in Australia is in Sydney on July 2nd and 3rd.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>About apeX:</strong><br />
Since it's creation in August 2010, apeX has quickly shown they are one of the top gaming organisations in Europe, with recent events such as i42 and ECL Blackpool where apeX took first place and second place respectively in FIFA 11, with very positive results in CoD B.O also.<br />

		<title>ACL Reach FFA Online Round Two Wrap Up</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-reach-ffa-online-round-two-wrap-up-r76</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/reach-ffa-r2-wrapup.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Halo has long been our flagship game here at ACL, and while traditional 4v4s have always been the main attraction to our competitors, this year we have kicked off a brand new Halo Reach Free For All Pro Circuit. Like our 4v4 tournaments, FFA tournaments will be held online and be played at LAN events all throughout the year. Not only does this add more fierce competition to the ACLPro Circuit, it also allows new and up and coming players a chance to prove themselves amongst some of the most experienced and skilled veteran players in Australia. FFA is a very different game to 4v4, while in 4v4s you must rely on advanced communication and teamwork, in FFA you must rely only on yourself and your own individual skill. </strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Australian Cyber League has already held an ACL Reach FFA Online Round 1 tournament as well as a Reach FFA Tournament at ACL Melbourne. These tournaments saw some of our most experienced and skilled players dominate the field, but also opened up the gates for some new talent to rise up amongst the ACL ranks and prove themselves as truly talented players. To view results and statistics from these two tournaments see Online Round 1 results <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2011/events/acl-reach-ffa-r1-landing-page' class='bbc_url' title=''>here</a> and ACL Melbourne results <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/2011/results/halo/acl-melb-reach-ffa-results' class='bbc_url' title=''>here</a>.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Round 1</strong></span><br />
ACL Halo Reach FFA Online Round 2 saw 88 of the best and most skilled players in Australia sign up for a chance to prove themselves amongst the ACL ranks.  All were aiming for that enticing first place finish and a chance to earn the right to title of the best in Australia. The first round of the tournament saw all competitors split into 11 pools and with the competition split this wide it gave some of ACLs finest the opportunity go on a demolition run in their opening match of the day on Zealot. We saw players such as Magician +19 and Benno +24 dominating their first pools, but no two players doing as well as Tranquillity +31 and KandeeCane +32 both putting up an impressive 65 kills. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Round 2</strong></span><br />
After round 1 of the tournament we saw the competition pool split in half, where the top players from each pool would head into Tier A round 2, and the rest would begin their journey through the Tier B competition.  Round 2 of the Tier A tournament saw even tighter competition where all players had enough skill to take out the wins in their own pools. Prophet was the selected map of Round 2 and even with the mixed opinions from our players it didn’t stop some of them putting on a show with Tranquility, Vital Notion and Blaze all putting up an impressive +17, Monk showing off a +19, and Talent boasting a huge +21. Unfortunately this would be the end of the line for some competitors, as FFA has no ‘Losers Bracket’, but congratulations for all who made it this far within such a vast sea of talent.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Quarter Finals</strong></span><br />
Next up was the Quarter Finals of the FFA tournament, the best of the best were split into 3 pools of 24 players, but only 16 would progress to the Semi Finals. Zealot would be the battleground for our Quarter Finalists, and having come so far already all would be dreading going home early. After 15 minutes of hard fought Halo we had three clear winners of each pool in Blaze going +12, Benno putting up the +13 and Deano executing a ridiculous +26 putting up a huge 66 kills. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Semi-Finals</strong></span><br />
If you make it to the Semi-Finals of a competition there is nothing more disappointing than not progressing to the Grand Finals, unfortunately that was the reality for half of our players in the FFA Semi-Finals. In Pool A the results were: <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>1.)</strong> Tranquillity +14<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2.)</strong> Vital Notion +7<br />
<strong class='bbc'>3.)</strong> Lunar -7<br />
<strong class='bbc'>4.)</strong> Hopey +5<br />
<br />
Who all progressed through to the Finals, while unfortunately Pulse, Deano, Lil Virus and Bulk just falling short. In Pool B we had: <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>1.)</strong> Talent +9<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2.)</strong> Benno +10<br />
<strong class='bbc'>3.)</strong> Monk +3<br />
<strong class='bbc'>4.)</strong> Kryptic 0<br />
<br />
Who all confirmed their position in the Finals and unluckily for Blaze, Dark, Fade and Jayce not being able to secure a spot. That finalised the Semi Final results for the ACL Reach FFA Online Round 2 competition with:<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>9.)</strong> Pulse<br />
<strong class='bbc'>10.)</strong> Blaze<br />
<strong class='bbc'>11.)</strong> Deano <br />
<strong class='bbc'>12.)</strong> Dark<br />
<strong class='bbc'>13.)</strong> Lil Virus<br />
<strong class='bbc'>14.)</strong> Fade<br />
<strong class='bbc'>15.)</strong> Bulk<br />
<strong class='bbc'>16.)</strong> Jayce <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Grand Final</strong></span><br />
The Grand Final was set up to be an epic match up, consisting of 8 of the most talented players who had proved themselves throughout the tournament and arguably some the best Reach players in Australia. As per the rules a vote was held before the match to decide which map would be played in the Finals and Prophet quickly earned 5 quotes before even asking all 8 players. The first 5 minutes of the match it was neck and neck with Hopey, Benno, Monk and Lunar all taking turns having the lead. After the 5 minute mark Benno managed to break away by a few kills and held it majority of the time up until the 10 minute mark. Hopey and Benno seemed to be neck and neck from 10 minutes on, both players seeming to go kill for kill to tie up the lead. This went on all the way up to 13.50 mark where Benno managed to again secure himself a small lead and was able to maintain that lead until the end of the match. Although in the dying minutes of the game it seemed to be only Benno and Hopey who would be the players to take it out, Lunar, Tranquillity and Talent where never too far behind, showing the incredibly even level of skill and competition in the Grand Finals match. The Final Results of the Top 8 of the ACL Reach FFA Online Round 2 tournament were:<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>1.)</strong> Benno<br />
<strong class='bbc'>2.)</strong> Hopey<br />
<strong class='bbc'>3.)</strong> Lunar<br />
<strong class='bbc'>4.)</strong> Tranquility<br />
<strong class='bbc'>5.)</strong> Talent<br />
<strong class='bbc'>6.)</strong> Monk<br />
<strong class='bbc'>7.)</strong> Vital Notion<br />
<strong class='bbc'>8.)</strong> Kryptic<br />
<br />

<br />
With ACL Melbourne wrapped up, ACL's FIFA 11 season takes the next step to Online Round 2. After the successful finish to the first FIFA 11 LAN, we are looking to make Online Round 2 bigger, better and more competitive than any previous ACL FIFA 11 competition!<br />

<br />
This tournament will include a new format which will be used for all future FIFA 11 Online competitions. Essentially there is a Pro bracket for the Top 8 players based on seeding points from previous tournaments as well as an Open bracket for every player outside the Top 8. The Top 8 players from the Open bracket will meet the Pro bracket players in the finals. <br />
<br />
This structure can be viewed in more depth <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/procircuit/fifa-2011-structure' class='bbc_url' title=''>HERE</a>.<br />

		<title>ESF Article - Timeout with Somedude</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/esf-article-timeout-with-somedude-r72</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/8582/timoutwsomedude.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #F4A500'>Today, Peteh from ACL sits down with Somedude, the recent bronze medallist of FIFA at the recent ACL Melbourne event. Somedude is a well known and respected competitor in the FIFA ranks as well as across other titles in recent ACL history.</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #F4A500'>ACL: Thanks for your time Somedude, can you start off by telling us a bit about yourself?</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Name:</strong> Eric Kordabalos<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Gamertag:</strong> Ahhh Somedude<br />
<strong class='bbc'>State:</strong> Victoria<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Favourite Team:</strong> Liverpool<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Favourite Player:</strong> Suarez<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Controller Settings:</strong> Crossing/Lob Pass assistance: Semi. The rest are on default.<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Hobbies:</strong> Playing guitar, chilling with friends and gaming<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #F4A500'>ACL: Now, you've competed in a fair few online competitions and have attended multiple ACL LANs across various titles, can you tell us a bit about your history with ACL and beforehand, AusHalo?</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Somedude:</strong> It all started late 2008 when Troy (Trazza), James (Cripsy), James (Crazyjoker) and myself watched the MLG Las Vegas Championships. It was such an awesome event and we were all hooked on the idea of competitive gaming so we wanted to see if we could find something similar in Australia. A month or so later, we found out about GoSolid and competed in a few LANS under the name of Team JJET.<br />
<br />
Looking for a larger community, we found out about Aushalo and competed in the first online tournament in 2009. CrazyJoker left the team and we picked up Brandon (Brandz) and competed under the name of Prelude. Although we placed terribly, I found myself hooked on the idea of playing a video game competitively and so I continued to compete in Aushalo events.<br />
<br />
Since that point on I've tried my best to stay in touch with the community by posting on the forums and competiting at LAN/Online events and although I was pretty garb at Halo 3, I'm extremely glad that I stuck with it throughout the 09' and 10' season until now, where I game FIFA instead at ACL.<br />

		<title>ACL Stats Central V2 Launch</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-stats-central-v2-launch-r71</link>
		<description><![CDATA[We will be launching V2 of Stats Central today, so I thought I would let you all know what you can expect, and what you can be looking forward to in the future.<br />
<br />
First off, the major change is that we're taking Stats Central from just Halo to a multi game statistics service. So it will truely be Stats Central for all things ACL. If ACL has a game on its circuit, then it will be represented in Stats Central now. Some in more involved ways than others.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/news/newstatshomepagepromo.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
Right off the bat today, some of the sections will be lacking a bit in content, this is due to the fact that we havent had the time to enter the new information to the new system yet. But we wanted to get it out so you could see for yourselves what is coming as we enter the data. So, as some of the data is yet to be enterred for certain games, there are places where it will be pre loaded with Halo data so you can get the feel for it. Rest assured this will be a VERY temporary and will we have the proper stats in there ASAP.<br />
<br />
Apart from the change to add in multiple games, there are now a few more changes, with more to come soon in the pipeline:<br />
- From your profile page you will now be able to see which games you play/played and your stats for each game as well as a link to all matches played.<br />
- The home page will now have a summary of all titles.<br />
- There will be more stats pages you can check to see how your rank against Australias best!<br />
<br />
Things nearing completion<br />
- Detailed stats for new games<br />
- Lots more detail for each players profile.<br />
- Stats Archive for previous seasons<br />
<br />
Starting work on soon<br />
- Swiss system display for fighters<br />
- Thinking about adding in medals/awards for things in tournaments (perfections etc) that will be shown on player profiles.<br />
<br />
So, we hope you like V2, and over the coming weeks we cannot wait to show you its full potential.<br />
<br />
To keep up to date with development of Stats Central, you can follow me on twitter <a href='http://www.twitter.com/ACLCavey' class="bbc_url">@ACLCavey</a>]]></description>

<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Vibe:</strong></span> I first starting playing halo 2 at mates house. I’d usually go over there once a week with a group of mates and just play halo 2 customs all night. When halo 3 came out I still didn’t own a 360  that was when one of my mates got a 360 so I went over to try out halo 3. I Found it so much fun so I deiced to get a 360. Then I played halo 3 for a while mostly with Americans, then I slowly got into MLG. I ended up finding a few Australian’s searching in MLG thats when I got into Australian MLG customs.<br />
<br />
I first heard about ACL about 2 years ago I used to play a fair of halo 3 with kerem (haunted) and he found a team with some players on ACL so thats where I first heard about it. I always wanted to play in a serious team but never had the time as I was too busy with school, sports ect.<br />

There has been a mix of positive and constructive feedback from the community and we love hearing it. We appreciate your enthusiasm and support for the circuit and we have been listening. Because of this we are proud to announce another testing competition to allow the community to get involved and voice their opinions on changes that might be implemented into the circuit's future events.<br />

<br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 17px;'><strong class='bbc'>REGISTRATION & DISCUSSION</strong></span><br />
<br />
A registration thread has been created &lt;LINK&gt; and we encourage all teams new and old to sign up and compete. <strong class='bbc'>Each team can have a maximum of 5 members</strong>. Registration LOCK and confirmation due date will be on Friday 29th April 11.59pm.

<br />
Below is what we have gathered from feedback that was expressed to us by the community and might be changes that will be implemented into the competition and we would like YOU to trial it.

<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>Gameplay Rule Changes and Additions</strong></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Perks</strong><br />
-Scavenger Banned<br />
<strong class='bbc'><br />
Map Additions and Removals</strong><br />

<strong class='bbc'>Overtime</strong><br />
CTF Overtime to change to 2.5 minute rounds from 5 minute rounds<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>Connection Issues</strong></span><br />
After some problems with connection issues we are taking a new approach in finding the best possible way to maintain a fair match. Please read below.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Domination</strong><br />
If a player disconnects in Domination, the team with the disconnected player has 10 seconds to decide if they are going to play a man down and try to invite him back in. If they choose to end the game, they are required to go to spectator mode, the game is ended and the scores are recorded. As a result of stopping the game they will suffer a penalty and the other team will be awarded an additional 15 points to their current score. The remaining time will be matched up with the nearest game setting available. They have 5 minutes to get there player back in or to find a replacement. After 5 minutes the match will be restarted and play out the remaining time.<br />
<strong class='bbc'><br />
Capture the Flag</strong><br />
If a player disconnects in Capture the Flag, end the match when both flags are returned to their home base at the same time. The scores are recorded and 1 flag is awarded to the other team. The remaining time of that half will be matched up with the nearest game setting available. They have 5 minutes to get there player back in or to find a replacement. After 5 minutes the match will be restarted and play out the remaining time.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Search and Destroy</strong><br />
If a player disconnects in Search and Destroy at the start of the round the team has to team kill immediately (within the first 10 to 15 seconds). If kills have occurred prior to the player disconnecting the match must continue on and if the team who lost a player starts team killing they will lose the round. If a player times out mid round the match will be ended at the conclusion of that round. They have 5 minutes to get there player back in or to find a replacement. After 5 minutes the match will be restarted and play out the remaining time.<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><br />
<em class='bbc'>All rules and decisions are at the discretion of the admin team all decisions are final</em></span><br />
<br />
<hr class='bbc' /><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday Pool Play Information</strong><br />
A thread will go up on Saturday with confirmed teams in their respective pools with match details on who they are versing and on what maps. Please ensure all team captains read this BEFORE Sunday and add opposing team captains.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please keep the thread on topic. If you have any questions feel free to reply here and the admin team will answer your questions as soon as possible<br />
<br />
Thanks guys, The ACL admin team look forward to working with you!]]></description>

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Razer to help ACL take Australian gaming to the next level.</strong></span><br />
<em class='bbc'>Razer providing support to Australian Cyber League in the 2011 season</em></span><br />
<br />
At ACL Melbourne last weekend, The Australian Cyber League (ACL) announced a partnership with competitive gaming powerhouse Razer which will see the Razer Onza Tournament Edition be named as the official controller of the ACLPro Circuit for 2011.<br />
<br />
The Razer Onza Tournament Edition has been designed specifically for competitive console gaming, providing the highest level of precision, accuracy and comfort available for gamers.<br />
<br />
The controller features dials on the front which allows users to individually fine tune the tension on each of the joysticks. Other features include a completely revamped D-pad, improved triggers, hyper-action buttons, and the ability to re-map all of the buttons.<br />
<br />
Director of ACL, Nick Vanzetti, said the news of this partnership is further proof of ACL making great leaps in the Australian competitive gaming scene.<br />
<br />
“Razer is the undisputed leader in competitive PC gaming. With them making the move into the console scene, we’re so excited to be able to partner together,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Our competitors love gaining the edge over their opponents through state-of-the-art headphones and monitors. Controllers are the next, and arguably most important step in gaining that competitive edge. Through choosing Razer controllers we’re enabling our competitors to perform at their peak.”<br />
<br />
Attendees had the chance to get their hands on the controller through various demo stations situated around the tournament over the course of the weekend.<br />
<br />

<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Venue Parking:</strong></span><br />
If you are wishing to drop your equipment off at the venue first then park your car then drive up to the control gate, press the intercom and say that you're going to the Union Hall. From there, drive to the hall and carry in your equipment. Cars cannot be left in the drop-off area for more than ten minutes. Drive back out past the control gate again and into car park 3 (as seen on Campus Map above) then walk back to the hall and enter the LAN. Car park 3 is nearest to the hall, otherwise use car parks 1, 2, 2a or 6.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Food & Drinks:</strong></span><br />
There is also a local McDonalds about 15mins walk away from the venue and if you can drive there is also other local fast food restaurants located a bit further away as well. Last year there was a Campus Canteen open inside the Venue that served hot food and drinks but it is unconfirmed at this time if it will be open again this year. We will have ice cold soft drinks available for purchase in the venue and of course you are always free to pack your own lunch. <br />

<span class='bbc_center'>Hello guys  <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> As some may know there was one hell of a game on Thursday night between two great teams. Sit back and enjoy  the report of what could possible be the most epic comeback Australian COD has ever seen to date.<br />
<br />
So lets get into it!<br />
</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 21px;'>Mindfreak.RAZER</span></strong>  <br />

<span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'>Fitzy | Guardian | Cheese | Phantm</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'>The first time these two teams matched up was during the Top 16 Double Elimination Finals Round 2 on Sunday the 27th. The following is what went down:</span><br />
<span class='bbc_center'>CTF Havana-DRAW<br />
DOM Firing Rang-Fray<br />
SND Summit-Fray<br />
CTF Hanoi-DRAW	<br />
DOM Summit - Fray<br />
</span><br />
With the ACL continuation rule coming into play when two teams meet up again during the Finals,Fraystarted with a strong 3-0 lead in the Loser Finals against Mind.Freak.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Firing Range - CTF</strong></span></span></span><br />

</div><br />
It started off with Fray going straight down to business with Fitzy on Mindfreaks flag in the first 30 seconds. Dazed almost stopped Fray from going in the lead as he picked up Fitzy right near Frays spawn but Cheese was there to clean him up and successfully captured the flag. It was another two minutes of tight gameplay before Fitzy took off again, this time, successfully running it the whole way by himself. At the  1 minute mark Fitzy did it again, shortly followed by Guardian who with incredible team worked picked up another flag and then another one by Fitzy again. These quick flag captures put Fray in a 5-0 lead at half time, with Cheese going huge with his kill count. <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Second Half</strong></span></span></span><br />
Second half came and Fray were looking good for the win.Mindfreakcame storming out and refused to give up capturing a flag in the first minute. The next couple of minutes was just dominant Mp5ks everywhere before Fray picked up the last flag of the map to make the second half 1-1, and the full time score 6-1 Frays way. <br />

<span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Hanoi - Domination</strong></span></span></span><br />
It started off nicely for Mindfreak with them holding two flags, but Fray quickly adapted and took A flag. Mindfreak tried to pushed A but Cheese was just shutting them down, until the finally got him down and took back A flag. Fray retaliated and captured the flag back and Mindfreak tried desperately to take control of it again but were unable to get the cap due to Fitzy and phantms' precision nade. Things were looking down for Mindfreak as they tried to gain ground but unfortunately Fray was too strong and in the dieing seconds of the half Fray captured all 3 flags leaving the score at 156-121 Frays way. <br />

</div><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Second Half</strong></span></span></span><br />
Second half started off with a bang asMindfreakquickly capped C and had 3 of their players running to A to contest it straight after Fray had captured it for a few moments. They successfully shut Fray out of the area and took it. With some nice double kills by Cheese, Fray were able to take C off Mindfreaks hands. They then took A off Mindfreak and dominated the map. Shortly after Mindfreaklooked to get back in the game and were about to cap A back, BOOM! Fitzy with a double nade and then a nice dropshot to stop them. Although Fergiwas nearby and was able to pick him up and get the cap. Mindfreak were in need of two flags if they wanted to have any chance of winning this map, but Fray were just too strong and took out the map with the total score of 307-249<br />

</div><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Villa - SND</strong></span></span></span><br />
With Fray only needing one more game to take it out, it was do or die for Mindfreak.<br />
The first round Fray was on defence. They held it solid defensive line with not one member of Fray going down and it was looking like they were going to take this game out. The second round Fray attacked and pushed B, got the bomb down successfully with Cheese picking up a double kill to secure another round. Now down by 2-0, Mindfreak pushed B to get the bomb down as they cleaned up 3 Fray players with zeeeQ cleaning up Cheese for the final kill to secure the round. The next round saw Fray on attack again pushing B hard, it quickly turned into a 4v3 situation in favor of Fray, but with some nice teamwork by zeeeq and Dazed over at B they were able to bring it back to a 3v1 situation withphantm the last one alive. Phantm went large and took out 2Mindfreak members berfore Rapture cleaned him up. Each team traded rounds 1 for 1 and neither team could get a 2 round lead to take out the map. Until finally Mindfreak stepped up and took out the game 8-6.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Summit - CTF</strong></span></span></span><br />
After 5 wins to Fray, Mindfreakfinally got a score on the board. Mindfreak were on a high and were hoping to keep the momentum flowing. The first 2 minutes neither team did too much damage with both teams going defensive and trading kill for kill. Fray managed to get the game going and took out 3 Mindfreakplayers, they quickly tried to take advantage of the situation and went for a flag cap but were shut down.Mindfreak then went for a counter cap with Fergi getting a massive triple at Frays spawn and ran the flag the whole way home. Fray tried to tie the round and went for another cap but were shut down by a strong Mindfreakdefence. The half ended with a 1-0 lead to Mindfreak. <br />

</div><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Second Half</strong></span></span></span><br />
The second half didn't start much like the 1st with Mindfreak quickly caping a flag in the first minute. The next couple of minutes were slow with Fitzy just going large with his AK. Fray tried to go for another flag, but still, Mindfreak just too strong and returned the flag. Mindfreak then set up 3 solid defenders, but Cheese came in guns blazing like a mad man to take 2 of the defending players out with the help of his team mate taking out the 3rd and Fray were able to pull their first cap. Mindfreakregrouped then set up again, but Fray took them down again. With 15seconds left of the clock Fray took MindFreaks flag. With 5 seconds left on the clock Guardian was just meters away from the capture point to take the map into overtime but Dazed barges through their defences and in with a double kill! He saves the flag and takes the victory for Mindfreak!<br />

</div><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Villa - Domination</strong></span></span></span><br />
Mindfreak now pulled 2 in a row and that slight feeling of "wouldn't this be great if we pulled this back?" starts to creep into their mind, and with that, Mindfreak came into the next game pumped up and ready to pull this back. Mindfreak looked in control from the start, holding two flags for most of the half, Fray came back into the game to hold 2 flags but Mindfreakquickly recaptured the flag straight. All players of Mindfreak were doing their part in this half and played well together. They ended this half 170-104<br />

</div><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Second Half</strong></span></span></span><br />
Fray came out looking better this half, they took 2 flags straight up, but Mindfreak took over quickly and held both A and B for a while, then Fray came back and held 2 for a couple of minutes to take the lead but needed 3 flags to win. As Fray looked to take the last flag, Rapture cleaned them up and went for a counter attack to allow Mindfreak to capture B. Fray came out hard again taking over B but with a minute left Mindfreak got it back. Fray captured it back one last time and won the half 147 to 132 but it wasn't enough and Mindfreak took the win. <br />

</div><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Hanoi - CTF</strong></span></span></span><br />
3 maps straight, 3 to win. Mindfreak was just on fire right now. 1 minute in Mindfreak got the first cap. It was 2 minutes in before Fray touched their flag and almost ran it home before Fergi cut them off with only meters to go. At this stage, Mindfreak had 3 solid defenders, and it seemed to work, Fray managed to touch the flag once but got shut down very quickly. Leaving the half time score 1-0 Mindfreaks way.<br />

</div><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Second Half</strong></span></span></span><br />
Second half started pretty slow with most of Mindfreak hanging around their flag. Fray managed to touch the flag, but like normal, were taken down almost straight away. Fray came hard again, this time they were able to run the flag out of danger. Just as Fray were about to cap the flag Rapture picks up the kill and Fergi jumps on the return. Fray were able to grab the flag 2 more times but were unsuccessful with both, ending the half at 0-0 and the full time score at 1-0 Mindfreaks way. <br />

</div><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Havana - CTF</strong></span></span></span><br />
Mindfreak had brought it back to 4-5, was it possible they could win? Havana took off nice and slow as it kicked into gear. With not much happening, both teams ended up going up each other side of the map. Fray were the first team to make a break with a flag, but as they were running backMindfreak picked up theirs, with a couple of kills it seemed sure Fray were about to cap, but zeeeQ denied them and went large picking up a double and returning Mindfreaks flag inches away from Frays flag. <br />
<div class='bbc_spoiler'>
	<span class='spoiler_title'>Spoiler</span> <input type='button'  class='bbc_spoiler_show' value='Show' />

</div><br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Second Half</strong></span></span></span><br />
Again it started off slow, Fray went for a take at 2 minutes in but were shut down by a solid Mindfreakdefence. Mindfreak went for a counter capture, but Fray said no thankyou and took their flag back instantly. With 2 minutes to go Dazed made a run for it with Frays' flag. With great cover from his team they picked up a flag and put themselves in the lead, Fray looked to counter cap but Fergi held strong and picked up the double, Fray tried again, desperately with only 1 minute left but it didn't work, then Fergi grabbed Frays flag and ran down fountain side, successfully capping it, with 20 seconds left it was all over and done for the map of Havana, and both teams now move into the Map decider with Mindfreak on the comeback train. <br />
<div class='bbc_spoiler'>

</div><br />
<span class='bbc_center'><span style='color: orange'><span style='font-size: 21px;'><strong class='bbc'>Havana SND</strong></span></span></span><br />
Well this was it, possibly one of the biggest comebacks in the making, down 5-0 to pull it back 5-5 to take it to a map decider. Win or lose for Mindfreak they had played exceptional to do what they had just done. <br />
The first round started off with Mindfreak on the defence, Fergiquickly picked up a double following zeeeq picking up a kill then Rapture secured the round taking out Guardian after he cleaned up two of the Mindfreak members. The next round saw Mindfreak take a hard A that Fray could not handle and it showed for a quick round. The next round Fray pushed B, and managed to get the bomb down but unfortunately could not hold the defence down and Mindfreak got the defuse making it 3-0. <br />
It was do or die now for Fray on the Defence, and they managed to take the round with Cheese going large on a team down to take the final kill in a 1v1 situation. But they couldn't comeback from 3-1 down and Mindfreak came out hard and fast to secure the round. Winning the game 4-1.<br />

<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Not everyone might know but you've been a part of the Australian Halo community for quite some time, and had a lot of success throughout your career. Can you tell us long how you've been gaming for and how you first got into playing Halo titles competitively?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I've been competitively gaming since 2004 (locally), 2005 (nationally) and 2007 (internationally). Prior to that I gamed for fun through the 90s playing all the awesome games on the n64/play station, SC on my iMac and CS 1.5-1.6/War3 on PC from 2000-2004.<br />
<br />
I got into halo when it was first released in Australia, I purchased an xbox just to play it. I began lanning with friends in late 2003/early 2004 and competed in the WA WCG Halo 1 (1v1) qualifier where I placed 2nd to my long time friend and former team mate "The X". That was the first halo lan tournament I competed in and what sparked my competitive drive.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Can you tell us a bit about the Halo scene back then, how big or successful it was? What sort of tournaments did you have back then?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I can't really speak about the Halo 1 competitive scene since that was centralised in Brisbane. In Perth I had a good group of school mates that would lan against other groups of friends from different schools, who we would consistently beat and trash talk haha -  those were my nub/fun days. I recall one time a local team literally throwing a couch at my friends Ice Spectre and Shiatsu in frustration. No one was harmed but it was amusing none the less <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /><br />
<br />
The H2 scene was really interesting since it was the first time Halo was available on xbox live and that brought out a whole array of different personalities and consequently a lot of drama. In terms of how big it was it fluctuated quite substantially: in 05 there were two major 4v4 Tournaments Bigpond and Aussiexbox which produced huge numbers (I think over 100 or competitors). I did not compete in these due to year 12 commitments at the time. The reason the numbers were so high was due to the large amount of social gamers that attended following the release of h2, back then there wasn't as much of a known community hierarchy and by that I mean most people thought they were the awesome and hence competed thinking they could win. Later in 05 there was WCG nationals which Cabel and Senyo won, there was about 12 2v2 teams that competed in that event as you had qualify by placing at state local events. Following WCG the competitive community died down a little as no major corporate sponsored events lay on horizon. This resulted in the birth of the original ACL - a community based organisation that run online events and a National LAN tournament in 2006. <br />
<br />
In 2006 there were online 4v4, online 2v2 and online FFA events using the double elim format most are familiar with today. Teams were also generally made of people from the same state with a few exceptions in cmx/nsk. The amount of competitive teams would have peaked mid 2006 at around 6 (NSK, NaP, CmX, DK, KMP, DTP) with about 12 teams in total competing at Nationals. Although the number appears low relative to recent ACL events and the Bigpond/Aussiexbox it was substantial in terms of the fact that the 6 teams were all considered to be fairly even prior to Nationals and no team was really the favourite going in. To summarise ACL Natioanls NSK won the 4v4 (Dante, Weazle, ToxicPie, Falcon), F8 won the FFA and I won the 1v1. <br />

<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'>Hax - one of the most experienced and knowledgeable players in Australia.</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Tell us about the Halo 2 BBR. How long did it take you to get yourself to the top with that Team? And who was your top competition back in those days?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> BBR was formed following ACL Nationals in 2006. I recall sitting on the plane back from ACL Nationals (Sydney) in 2006 thinking that in order to get to no1 I had to seek out the best possible team mates and bring them together. After I arrived back home I contacted Adz (known as OMEGA ADZ back then) and Berserka whose respective teams, DK and DTP, had quit or were in the process of disbanding. Somehow Xantics also ended up on team and we competed in our first online event placing 2nd to team Complex who would remain our primary competition during late Halo2 era and Halo 3 era.  Following this Game1 was announced and we dropped Xantics and picked up Dante (who approached us for the recored haha). After that we won everything including a Cod2 and Cod4 competition until about mid 2009. I would say our main competition was complex during H2, TE during H3 in 2008 and then finally iNC who was first team to knock us off no1 since mid 2006 when they won their first online event.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Transitioning from Halo 2 to Halo 3 BBR was still as dominate in early Halo 3 as it was in Halo 2. How did you and your Team find the transition? Did BBR like Halo 3 after playing Halo 2 for so long?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> To be honest we didn't like h3 that much but we were so focused on winning that it didn't really bother us until we started losing haha. I would say we had to work a lot harder in H3, most event wins felt like the culmination of a lot handwork whilst with H2 we basically wouldn't practice and still win. Its worth noting that both Dante/Bererska quit in early 2008 and thats when the most widely known BBR was born (myself/adz/dockoh/kself). Kself and Dockoh both hadn't been no1 before so regardless of whether or not they liked the game they both had an intense drive to practice which was a major component of our success at the time. Shoutout to Tom and Matty!!!<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: For the first 2 years of Halo 3 BBR had huge success winning all LAN events and winning the majority of Online Event, really cementing BBR as the first Australian Halo Dynasty. BrisLAN 09 however saw BBR place third, their worse placing on LAN since Halo 3s release. What do you think the was the reason that lead to your third place finish? And why did the Dynasty of BBR disband following BrisLAN 09?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> There were a lot reasons but at the same time I hate making excuses so I'm just gonna go with the primary factor which was that we failed to develop the level of teamwork that TE and iNControl did. They simply worked harder and pushed the level of teamwork much higher than it had been before. The reason we disbanded was because competing was no longer fun and I suppose we had to much pride to continue losing - we had lost 2 previous online events as well so the lan was the just the final nail in coffin.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: After taking a short break at the end of Halo 3 everyone knows you are back and mean business. When starting playing competitively again it seemed like you had a preference of picking up 'new talent' as opposed to teaming with other Veteran Players such as yourself. Your Round 1 Team Hopey, Haunted, Aba and yourself, tells us a bit about that lineup and what it was like playing with that Team?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I got the idea from the original iNC which I saw as a group of highly motivated younger players that sought to out-practice their opponents (they had the time by virtue of their age and circumstances). I tested it in early 2010 after reloaded with brad/monks/naxik but concluded that the gap between iNC and rest of community was too large to overcome at that point especially with the addition of Benno. I had also completely lost interest in competing and felt as if I was doing an injustice to my team mates by continuing to play. After having a substantial break I came back for reach and thought of all the times this would be best to try this idea out as it was a new game. I went through a series of interesting lineups until I ended up with the above mentioned one. I basically just scouted players who I thought had long term potential, the only exception was Aba who I had teamed with in past in Cod/GoW/Graw. I enjoyed the experience at the time since everyone was really motivated and optimistic about potential of the team. I saw Hopey as emerging top player and Haunted as a player with a good concept of how to play but lacking confidence at the time (since then he has improved drastically!). <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: In ACL Online Round 1 that BBR lineup placed Second, a successful and respectable placing but you guys were definitely aiming for First. Why do you think you guys fell short? Why do you think nE was the better team on the day?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> Once again not one for excuses so I'd say they had better team game then we did at the time. We perhaps over-thought the game which bred doubt among team members which affected performance. One thing that frustrated me about that event was the fact that Aba and myself had to run it on the day (no fault of ACL but rather some lame hackers) which added a lot more stress to competition. That said I doubt the result would have changed. <br />

<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'>Hax playing in Online Round 1 against Malice</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: After Round 1 BBR made some line up changes trying to get the best roster they could. Before anything was set in stone however iNControl (now Infused) approached you about a position on their team. What was going through your head at that time when they asked you to join? And was it hard to leave BBR after how much hard work you guys had put in?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I was like yesssss im no1 again, although at the same time I felt like I hadn't earned it and I had to prove myself again. It wasn't a hard choice, the dynasty that was BBR had ended after Brislan 2009, what followed was a series of experiments. None the less I respect all the hard work the preceding lineups put in. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FFA500'>ACL: So being on Infused must be incredibly exciting. The talent and possibilities for you guys are endless. How have you guys been going together? How do you find yourself fitting in on the Team? </strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I think we are doing alright, we barely lose so thats obviously a good sign but at same time I feel as if we could be performing better if I was better at the game and didn't have an assignment after assignment in my third week of uni <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/sad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: As everyone knows your Teammates Benno, Heff and Voltage attended MLG Columbus last year where they placed an incredible 17th place. The time and effort these guys have put into Halo is completely unmatched by any other players in Australia. Whats it like teaming with these guys? And how far do you think you have come personally since joining Infused?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> Basically Heff/Benno/Tage are ridiculously far ahead of everyone in the community. I don't think I'm anywhere near their level yet but I'm trying to work on that. At the moment I just try take in all advice they provide and add it to my game. A point to be made is that they think a lot more about the game than I previously thought. They analyse so many different situations and have an astounding level of team awareness/memory. My general play-style has shifted from passive to pretty much pushing most of the time, so thats an improvement but at the same time I lack the awareness they have so it's hard to know when to time some things. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: You have been on the Best Halo 2, Halo 3 and now Halo Reach Team. I think we can easily say you are one of the most successful and talented players in Australia. How have you found playing Halo over all these years? Did you ever get bored of playing the series? And how did you keep yourself motivated to put in the hours and perfect your skills to be so dominate over the years?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I've enjoyed it the whole time, regardless of Halo's faults it still kicks the shit out of any other competitive console game and also because I enjoy being better at something than others as vain as that sounds. I did sort of burnout after Reloaded 2010 but following a substantial break my drive returned.  I don't really care about the game as much as I care about winning, so as long as their competitions I should be able to stay motivated.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: How do you think the game has changed from being on Top from earlier Halo games to Reach? And how has the gaming community or scene changed?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I feel that the whole competitive scene has become a lot more refined and integrated. Back when I started things were a lot more local, than they became state based and now teams are made up of players from all around the country. Another thing that fundamentally changed the competitive Halo was Theatre. I find that top players are generally very analytical and this was godsend to them, allowing individuals and teams to understand consequences of decisions in real time over and over.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong> Ok looking forward to the first season of Halo Reach, not just here at ACL but internationally as well. I'm sure I speak for most of the community when I ask we are dying to know when you guys will be competing overseas in European and MLG events?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> Unfortunately I can't confirm anything yet but the goal is to compete internationally at a euro event then possibly MLG.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Looking locally now, ACL Melbourne is just around the corner. Obviously Infused are the fan favourite to take out First place. What teams do you think will contest you the hardest? And what players in the ACL community outside of Infused really impress you?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> Fray are practising hard and will definitely be playing us in the finals outside of them I'm quite ignorant as to who is good now haha sorry about that.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: There will also be a Reach FFA Competition at ACL Melbourne and I know your teammate Benno is counting on the prize money for a good time in Melbourne. Who would you tip to take out the FFA Comp? And can you list some players you would expect to see in the FFA Finals?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> Benno, Tage, Hef, Hopey, Haunted, Natural Talent, Fade and hopefully myself <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>Lastly, the MLG v3 settings have just recently been released. From what you have seen so far what do you like and dislike about the v3 settings? Anything you wished MLG would have put in and they didn't?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> I wished MLG would take out sprint but other than that I just wanted a midship remake in. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL: Shoutouts?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Hax:</strong></span> Everyone I've ever teamed with and Australian competitive community. Massive shoutout to SammyK and NatB, you guys are amazing and Melbourne wouldn’t be possible without you guys.

<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FFA500'>ACL:</span> Tell us how long you have all been gaming, and what was the first game that got you hooked into gaming?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Roylanfan:</strong></span> I've played halo since h1 with my dad and brother, but very, very casually and I was a total noob. My brother had to always force me to play with him but when I moved to australia at the end of '07 I started playing halo3 alot more since there was absolutely nothing else to do in our small cramped apartment. My brother found out about MLG and the first event I watched was Meadowlands '08 with FB taking it out. I found out about Neighbor and developed a tiny little crush which eventually bloomed into me searching the mlg playlist every night (i was a 20ish rank) hoping I could matched up with him. Found about ACL late 08' and met Ian(Blainz) and Transitiion(Taylor) who helped me get into it.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> I've been gaming since I was three when my dad first bought the NES with super mario. Since then I'd always been hooked, playing stuff like goldeneye or mario kart with mates but it wasnt till I got an Xbox and Halo CE that I started to get really into gaming. When I found ACL towards the end of halo 2 and start of Halo 3... Thats when shit got real! Hahah.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Ive gamed on PC since i owned one, but Doofus and some school mates got me hooked into console halo 3 just under two years ago.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #000000'>Toddles:</span></strong> I have been gaming since the days of the sega but the first game that really got me hooked would have to be halo 2 with xbox live to play multiplayer. I would spend hours playing online when my brother wasnt dowloading and screwing with my internet.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FFA500'>ACL:</span> How did you guys first find your way into ACL?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #008000'>Karloo:</span></strong> Simple answer: Doofus haha.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> I met this guy k0n5tantine (LOL i'm sure people can remember him) who I used to play with heaps...hahahah anyway he introduced me to ACL and I managed to make an account and make an introduction thread after much nervousness. As I said people like Ian and Taylor helped me out and also v J i m v who I remember always invited me to loads of customs. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span>I played a lot of MLG matchmaking (thinking i was top shit at level 45) and played with a friend of a friend (silverblade) who led to frantic who told me about the site, showing me that there were a heap of better players out there.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Transition and I used to play heaps of halo together and we couldn't find anyone that we knew who was better than us. We had searched for other people and communities but couldn't find any. One day we ran into the Teddies from Nuke and Pave in social slayer and then joined a few of their customs. It wasnt until then I realised just how terrible I was. I heard about ACL from them and Doofus who happened to be in the game and signed up straight away haha.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FFA500'>ACL:</span> X&Y is a relatively new team, but most of you have been around for a while. How come Karloo and Blainz were the only members from your current team to participate in ACL Reach Online Round 1?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>Royalfan:</span></strong> Well my extremely legit excuse was that I was overseas for the whole of december, I would have loved to play! <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> I had recently left/been dropped from IC due to constant disagreements with Tranquility and didn't really have a team. I got a few offers from other teams but was also unable to play on the saturday due to family commitments which i couldnt get out.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> I didn't know any of these guys with the h3/reach transition - I met some acl newbies like myself in reach's first month and got practising for R1.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Yeah I was on Fury with Asikk Cheez and Willgirzim. We placed 5th/6th (never played placement rounds with TSW) which was decent considering I was hating Reach and had hardly played it until the MLG rules came out.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> What did you think about the results of ACL Reach Online Round 1? Obviously it was a while ago now, and there have been a lot of team changes, but do you think the results mirrored the skills of teams back then? Were there any teams that particularly impressed or surprised you?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Well when I was on Fury I think a lot of people were suprised to see that we did as well as we did and I think we could've gone a lot further but there were constant issues with people, including myself not able to get on to practice after a few arguments decided to break up. Also round 1 people were still getting used to the game and players have improved a lot since then, not to mention the drop in players since the start of Halo Reach. Alot of the players have come back now though and theres a lot more competion which is good.<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><br />
<strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Ne's win was obviously suprising but those boys were well practised for R1. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span>The top 3 teams didnt surprise me with there placings though I was surprised with my old team IC finishing 7th when we were taking games of Malice (3rd) and having very close series.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> I wasn't really following too well...I was surprised to hear Fury placed so well though. Didn't really know anything about the other teams except BBR.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> Lets talk about X&Y now. You guys have been together for a a while now and have been gaming hard. X&Y have definitely established themselves as a Top 8 team online, maybe even pushing as high as top 4. How do you think you guys compare to the rest of ACL's top teams? Do you think you guys can hang with the best of the best?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Top 4 sounds good.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span>At the moment the only teams I feel that are better than us are Infuse and Fray, all the rest are either on par or not as good in my opinion. With my current job and uni we struggle to get in as much practice as we would like but by the time of Sydney we will be hoping to push Fray.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Yeah the core of our team minus Blainz now has been together since Janurary so thats definitely helped. If by top teams you mean fray and Infused, definitely not yet but with anyone else I'd say its fair game. We haven't won a game against fray yet but its good to play them and we've definitely been improving ever since picking up Blainz so hopefully we will be able to contest them soon. I'm not too fussed with the constant team changes I feel as long as we keep the core of our team together that will benefit us more than anything. I'm already so used to playing with Karl and Todd and their playstyles.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> I think we're becoming more solid as a team every time we practice but theres still a lot to improve on. I definitely think its possible for X&Y to take a top placing. We just need to keep working on our faults and im sure itll pay off.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> i would like to type the same 100 words as Shaki but then you would have two identical answer for the timeout..im agreeing completely with the team.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> Why do you think you guys have found more a more dominant in Reach than Halo 3? Do you think this team has the dominance to consistently sustain top 8 placements?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> I was never a sucess in h3 but im doing alot better in reach as every player has to go back to square one. Yep we can uphold a top 8 placement.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> The 2 things I felt let me down in H3 was my lack of individual skill and a long lasting team.Even though I placed 5th at Melb last year,we pretty much broke up straight after. My shitty internet connection for the first half of '10 was also a factor in me not getting picked up by teams. My communication and attitude to the game still remain the same but in Reach I'm way more confident in my DMR and pulling off clutch plays. Also I think I work best in a team and having a solid team to play with, unlike h3, makes me way better than I usually am. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> I feel like its a complete new game with maps and gametypes etc that it has just leveled the playing feild for most teams. As to sustaining a top 8 placement it think i will be relatively easy as long as we stay together as team.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Well I teamed with OHHD and that was my first proper team. I loved hanging out and teaming with them and even after I'd told them id stick with them, after some terrible placings eventually we all go sick of it and decided to break up. I think I definitely had the potential to place much higher. I had a team with Friction Royal and Spence shortly after Sydney which is probably one of the most strongest teams ive been on. We put up some really close games with Top Teams after the Sydney LAN last year but after a few issues with Spence and him refusing to take on board our advice he decided to tell me he was sick of me dick riding royal fan for agreeing with her and quit. From there it pretty much fell apart. Im definitely a better player at Halo 3 but with Reach I think we have a lot more teamwork going on.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> Lets talk more about your roles and abilities on X&Y. For a team to have success in Halo there is no doubt than any player must be able to fill in position at any time, but what do you think each member of X&Y brings to the team?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> I just about love Todd's communication, he plays on a really similar level to me so we naturally work well together. I've teamed with Blainz alot on LAN and online so I knew I was going to comfortable playing with him, he has always had sick individual awareness but ever since joining X&Y he has developed into a much stronger team player. He also has some of the clutchest flag runs ever! Karl's a relatively new player but there's no one thats tried harder to improve on this team than him. Sometimes we put alot of pressure on him but from Janurary till now, his improvement has been huge. He has a sick snipe(which he doesn't get enough of I admit) and his communication is great. One of the reasons I wanted to pick him up instead of someone with more experience is his attitude he's a pretty chill guy and takes onboard all the advice we give him and actually tries to work on it.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Todd is a very solid allround player. He's quite a dominant slayer but still a very team oriented player. Hes good at positioning himself for the team and communicating what needs to be done. Sharki has improved soo much since halo 3 its insane. Her individual skill has improved a tonne but she still has the teamwork and communication she relied on more so in halo 3. Karl is a very valuble player because of his empahsis on teamwork and his ability to go clutch quite often when needed. Its good to have seen him imprve so much in such a short period of time being quite a relativly new player<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Ty kind sir.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> Royalfan has unbelievable  communication and with her individual skill it makes her a really easy player to work with and you always know you have someone watching your back. Karl is the best objective play i know in Aus... but seriously he is always thinking and positioning himself well for when we pull flags and all. Blainz has filled Jayces role really well and is improving with our team and is much better than when he first joined us in all ways. I can now rely on Blainz in almost any situation wether it is supporting me or pulling objective at the right time.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Royalfan is a very team centred/focused and agressive player. Todd tends to slay and pick up assists being in the right place at the right time. Blainz and me mesh nicely pushing and helping each other out nicely great to play with an encouraging team.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> X&Y have been a busy team lately, and I have seen you guys getting in a lot of scrims and practice. One of the most interesting scrim results to note would be your games against iC as they seem to be close games, and most would say you and iC are very similar in skill level and experience. How have your scrims been going with them lately? And which team do you think has the edge, X&Y or iC?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Each scrim is different as every player is in a different mood/state of mind. I'm often very tired one evening and then prepared and ready to play the next afternoon. Yes they are very capable of taking slayer games off us but we have been setting up much more effectively with objective gametypes.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> What iC has over us...and its a big thing...is waaaaaaaay more practice time than we get. We lost pretty much every game to them a couple of weeks ago,  but just beat them 5-3 last week with the games we lost being really close. Its just scrims, but I honestly think we are stepping it up and if we continue that we will beat iC. If we get matched up with them this better be on main stage though cause its going to be intense! Stryfe is also a sick player on LAN so i'm definitely watching out for him.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> I think we've come a long way in the last two weeks since we've been getting some solid practice in and while we were struggling before I think we've all become more comfortable with our roles in the team. I know I definitely have and I think we'll have the edge over iC.  <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> The first set of scrims against them a couple of weeks ago the only way i could put it is we got raped. After those games it made us have to sit down and look at what we were doing wrong. After looking through all of this i have found it has made us a stronger team and our most recent scrim results would show this. It is all online though i do find that IC isnt all with it when it comes to objective and working as a team and we possibly have the edge over them but anything could happen at Melbourne.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> While we are talking about other teams lets touch on ACL's widely conceived top 3 teams; Infused, Fray and New Era. Infused with all their success, experience and practice from Halo 3, Fray with all their new found talent and practice, and New Era with their Round 1 win and dominant players. What do you think puts these teams above the rest? And do you see any Teams (such as Fray or New Era) catching the Infused dynasty any time soon?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Practice - I see these guys on all the time, whether it be 3 or 4members of their team scrimming or searching matchmaking. It helps so much, and with Todd and Karl's work + me having to jugggle all my school work and studying with halo its hard. Those teams also have players with insane individual skill but again that also comes from how long they spend playing. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> I think Infused has the advantage of being together so long and having so much experience playing with each other and getting used to the way they all play. Its possible for New Era and Fray to catch them I just dont think it will happen before ACL Melbourne. Team just need to stick together and have regular practice.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Infuse's time spent as a team gives them an obivous advantage not forgetting how amazing they are individually. Fray are close, up against infused but do not have the team experience on the clock. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Also though, Infused  have been together for ages unlike many other teams who swap members and break up over silly things. I think Fray will catch up with them if they stick at it, nE I'm not so sure. I have doubts on how long their going to stay together. If X&Y can stay together and work on things, *cross fingers* we can contest them. Thats always been my dream haha. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> Team work, co-ordination and excellent position is what i belive places them above the rest. If we make 1 mistake Fray always seem to capitalise on it and make us pay, we haevn't played Infused and with NE there current line up is nothing like there old one they have traded godlike an extremely smart and well skilled for shifty who never gets any objective time and just gets kills which has impacted on their overall teams performance and it shows.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FFA500'>ACL:</span> Unless you have been living under a rock you will have no doubt be aware of the release of the ACL Halo Reach Community montage, edited by the talent of Asikk and Doofus. What did you think of the montage? And with the massive exposure of the first one (Over 25,000 views and counting) can we expect to see some X&Y clips in the second ACL community montage?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> 3for1 on fray...haha. I will be submitting clips but i will submit after Melbourne.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> The editing/song was sexy, but tbh I wasn't massively impressed with the clips. As for X&Y clips, I would like to contribute but all my DMR triples which could lead to overkills but get stolen by karl aren't very impressive haha. Nah, I really need to work on getting multi kills. Its shameful nothing comes my way. I was hoping for an X&Y montage but we'll see.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> The montage was sick and was a great way to promote ACL and showcase players clips. Things like a community montage were tried in the past but never really had any success so im suprised it did so well. Asikk and Doofus did a great job Ill have to get some clips to submit for the second one.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Sorry to sound like such a downer on the tage, the exposure was great, the second one will undoubtedly better because hopefully we will see more clips from scrims and v3.<br />

<span class='bbc_center'><em class='bbc'>The first ACL Halo Reach Community Montage - edited by Asikk and Doofus</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> Lets of course talk about now the long anticipated first LAN stop of the 2011 ACL Pro Circuit: ACL Melbourne. With 15 Halo Teams and 15 CoD teams signed up alone, not to mention the numerous Fifa 11 and fighting game players that are going to be in attendance ACL Melbourne is set to be the biggest ACL event yet. How is X&Y feeling coming into ACL Melbourne? Confident, prepared, nervous?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> A little nervous as i have no competitive lan experience.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Bit nervous. Always takes me a while to get used to and feel comfortable on LAN so hopefully I can get some decent practice in beforehand but Im confident we'll perform well as a team.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> Im really keen to see how Reach plays on LAN but i think it will be a great event with lots of teams and hopefully it runs smoothly.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> I CAN'T WAIT FOR ACL MELB! I've had lots of LAN experience but still nervous because this is the 'actual thing' and there will be heaps of people watching (and judging) but at the same time more confident than I have felt at any other LAN cause of the team I have. We all get on well. Also can't wait to meet my teammates and chill with people from other teams.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> ACL Melbourne will not only be home to a Reach 4v4 tournament, but also the first official LAN stop of the ACL Reach FFA tournament. How do you guys rate yourself as FFA Players? I know you Toddles finished 8th in ACL FFA Online Round 1, making you a Pro FFA Player. Do you see yourself making top 8 again at Melbourne? Or maybe all of X&Y will make an appearance in the FFA finals?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> I used to be pretty decent at FFA's in halo 3. Not so sure about Reach. I keep forgetting to sign up haha Ill go do that now.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Todd is top 8 easy, people aren't prepared for the spam. I reckon out of our team Todd and Ian have the best chance of making it into the finals. I am just absolutely hopeless at FFA but I'm going to give it a good shot. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Hahah im just participating in FFA for fun not expecting finals or anything.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> Im hoping to make it to the FFA finals again after a disapointing last game in the online FFA and get a bit of redemption, it would be awesome if all of X&Y made it to the finals as  we all have the potential to but with so many good players out there like benno, cody and hopey i think for anyone it will be a challenge.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span><br />
i wouldnt want X&Y to become too FFAmous anyway. <br />

<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> As you will no doubt know MLG have finally released the v3 settings a few weeks ago. How does X&Y feel about the changes made between v2 to v3 settings? Anything you love or hate about the changes? And have you guys grown fond or foul of sprint </strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> I feel they are getting closer to perfecting there setting especially with the addition of new maps though i would like to see some king of the hill as i loved playing that on halo 3. Im not that fussed about sprint, i dont hate it or like it i just see it as a new aspect of the game just like bloom<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> I am dissapointed king of the hill was thrown out and they kept bomb on zealot and sanc.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> No not really. Im liking the v3 settings as v2 was starting to drive me insane with the lack of maps. Other than that I dont think too much has changed. I love and I hate sprint I can never make up my mind, the game works quite well without it though. When I got a chance to play without sprint at a small Melbourne LAN using settings similar to that of MLG with increased speed, the game was pretty intense. <br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Yeah I agree with Todd, I'm not a sprint hater, It's there, I'll use it the best I can. I reckon V3 is the best yet, I'm liking Nexus and Element though they'll take some getting used to. Worst thing about V3 is the recovery system of sitting right on the flag, it just makes everything so scrappy. I'd prefer the H3 system of the radius recovery.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> As MLG Dallas is right around the corner, a week before ACL Melbourne, I'm sure its an event that not only X&Y, but almost all of ACL will be tuning in for. In the spirit of the epic weekend that is sure to ensue, lets hear your predictions for MLG Dallas. Top 3 will suffice.</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Roylafan:</strong></span> Well tbh I haven't been following the pro teams that much since Reach came out but imexpecting that to change after the tourny. BUT IM GONNA HAVE TO go with my boys<br />
1.) FB<br />
2.) sQ<br />

<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> I also haven't been following it to much but based on results from TLN and other things i have seen i would say:<br />
1.)Darkest hour<br />
2.)Instinct<br />
3.)Belive the hype<br />

<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FFA500'>ACL:</span> As most Halo fans will know ACL has been updating their Youtube channel regularly with ACL Reach Pro Player Gameplays, which have been featuring some of the best gameplays from ACL's top players. ACL is keen to get their hands on some X&Y gameplay, have you got anything for us?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Do we?!?!?<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> Depends what you are looking for. Hopefully you will be seeing some soon.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> I have some against Outbreak.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> I have nothing<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Beware can I just upload some to my FS and you can grab the best ones.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Yeah we will get you some!<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> Thanks for your time Royal, Karloo, Toddles and Blainz but before we go I'm not sure if its only me who doesn't know but what is the exact meaning behind your team name X&Y?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> HAHAHA<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> I sure as hell dont. Axis' and maths and stuff.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> Well Royalfan?<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Its a very cool name, and revealing its origins would ruin its mystery and appeal. All you need to know is it came from a highly intelligent and creative mind.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> Thanks guy, and lets hear those shout outs!</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #008000'><strong class='bbc'>Karloo:</strong></span> Shoutout to Peter and Chris for the late night lunging.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #000000'><strong class='bbc'>Toddles:</strong></span> Shoutout to Schmutt for being awesome and all the ACL staff for doing such a good job over the last couple of years and hopefully many more to come.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Blainz:</strong></span> Shoutouts to all all my old team members OHHD Pyro, Satiex and Midst the widdly scuds. Fury - Asikk, Cheez and Will. nE for being top blokes at wills LAN. Definietly not monk cause he forgot me in his Timeout and heaps of other I cbf to type out. You'll know who you are. And definitely not Monk because he forgot me in his timeout, did I mention monk? NOT MENTIONING ME. Jayce for letting me play with X&Y and Vanz for being drunk infront of my mum.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Royalfan:</strong></span> Shout outs to my teammates, Taylor(transitiion) and Jayce. Also Vanz for organizing Melb its going to be amazing. Thanks beware for interviewing us as well.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</span> Thanks for the Timeout X&Y and best of luck at ACL Melbourne!</strong>]]></description>

<strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 9px;'>Written by Loki</span></strong><br />
<br />
<p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'>A source within IGN suggests that the American video gaming news giant will shortly be launching a North American Starcraft II Pro League with prizes worth up to $200 000.<br />
<br />
First reported by SK Gaming earlier today, this development would indicate a rather hefty investment on IGN’s behalf. According to SK’s anonymous insider, IGN will be providing a prize pool of between $150 000 and $200 000 for those players who manage to advance through the ranks. IGN themselves have confirmed the launch of their Pro League, via a somewhat anachronistic blog post dated 20th March.</div></div><br />

<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>This montage features our very own Lunar showing off some of his leftover clips that went towards the on-going creation of his first Halo Reach M1. For the fact that his montage is made entirely of leftover clips this the gameplay is very impressive, showing off some sick snipes, nice no scopes and sweet multikills. The editing is pretty simple yet enjoyable and flows well, certainly enough to keep you entertained. Congratulations Lunar for having his montage featured on FBWalshyFTW's youtube channel and getting it featured on the bungie.net homepage. Hope you all enjoy!</strong></span><br />

So this took way too long to finish. I got into contact with Lunar when he said he wanted someone to edit his leftover leftovers, I was just looking to try editing some Reach. I'm not gonna sell this short or oversell it, the video is what it is. This may very well be my last video, I never really reached where I wanted to as an editor and lately have just been extremely uninspired, part of the reason making this short vid took me over a month. Just wanted to thank Lunar for being patient with me, hope you all enjoy the video.</div></div><br />
<br />
<p class='citation'>Lunar said:</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'>
Hey guys this is my first Halo reach montage ill be releasing featuring the spare clips i got from the first few weeks of reach (lol). I know the gameplay isnt very good because of that reason, but i think Radic did a great job of making the entire tage enjoyable, hope you guys like it :-D Also be aware that the trailer for Lunars Reach M1 will be out very soon, be looking out for it ;-)</div></div><br />

		<title>ACL FFA Reach Forge Competition</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/acl-ffa-reach-forge-competition-r26</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk259/ilt12/Reach-ForgeComp-Banner.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><span class='bbc_center'><strong class='bbc'><span style='font-size: 17px;'>Official 2011 ACLPro Circuit FFA Halo Reach Forge Competition</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FFA500'>Like to mess around in Forge? Got a self-created map you've been playing around with? Hardcore Forger? Look no further. Today ACL is giving you the opportunity to submit your very own Map specifically forged for competitive FFA play. You will have the chance to be featured on our very own Reach FFA Pro Circuit and receive the recognition and prize you deserve!</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: #000080'><span class='bbc_underline'><strong class='bbc'>Overview:</strong></span></span></span><br />
This competition has been delayed in await of the impending release of the MLG v3 settings so Forgers know which settings (Player Speed, Jump Height, Gravity etc) to forge their Maps for. Since v3 has still not been released and we'd like to have your map ready in time for ACL Melbourne we are going to base all the player movements on the MLG v3 Test settings (of which details are listed below). If this deadline is proven to be too soon, then the competition will extend past ACL Melbourne to a month before ACL FFA Reach Online Round 2. Don't forget Sprint is confirmed for v3 settings so be certain to make sure your maps are suitable for Sprint! Be sure to use the test ACL FFA Gametype to test out your map, find it <a href='http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/FileDetails.aspx?fid=14137001&player=ACL%20Beware' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'><strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #FF0000'>here</span></strong></a>.<br />
<br />
At the moment the we only have one Map on our ACLPro FFA Reach Circuit and we'd like to provide another to add more entertainment and variety for all our competitors, cause lets face it one map can get stale after a while. The map we have at the moment is the FFA MLG variant of Zealot, this map can be found <a href='http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/FileDetails.aspx?fid=4287964&player=MLG%20Gametypes' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'><span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>here</strong></span></a>. <br />
<br />
Now as stated above all the submitted Maps must be specifically designed for FFA play-style. This doesn't mean you can't turn a 4v4 map you've made into a fantastic FFA Map, just that it must run smoothly and fairly in an FFA environment. <br />
<br />
The map MUST be forged on Forge World, and must have absolutely NO frame rate-lag. Your maps will be tested over and over and if any frame-rate lag is found your map will automatically be out of the running of the competition. The reason Forge World is the only map we will accept for submission is because not all players have the new DLC maps and none of the original maps accept Zealot suit FFA playstyle. So its entirely up to your own creative mind and a big and vast Forge World!<br />
<br />
Map size is left up to the digression of the Forger but obviously maps too big/small will affect how successfully the map plays, so be sure to get the size right in the early stages of your forge design. It would be a shame to have to completely start from scratch to fix your map!<br />
<br />
You may post your Map/s in this thread to request play-testers and obtain feedback between now and before the closing submission date, but when you are officially entering your map for submission you must send myself (Beware) a PM with the title "Official FFA Map Submission". You can PM me <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/index.php?app=members&module=messaging&section=send&do=form&fromMemberID=18' class='bbc_url' title=''><span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>here</strong></span></a>.<br />

		<title><![CDATA[Competition: Design ACL's 2011 Hoodie]]></title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/competition-design-acls-2011-hoodie-r24</link>

<br />
<span style='color: #FF0000'><strong class='bbc'>Win $200 designing ACL's 2011 Hoodie !!</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
So what's an Hoddie?  <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/unsure.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':unsure:' /> </span><br />
<br />
Well, a <em class='bbc'>hoodie</em> is a jumper with a hood, to keep your head warm. We're looking at doing a range of hoodies with a variation of the ACLPro logo and some slick new design for 2011. This will be customisable, so you can have your very own gamertag on the back. Still no clue? This is what 2010's hoodie's looked like: <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/2010hoodie.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<strong class='bbc'>2010 Hoodie Samples</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
We're making a call for all designers out there to get creative and make a new design for us in 2011. I can have GFX fail (above banner supplied by me). Not only will you win $200, but you'll have your handywork on every supporting member's hot gaming bod for many cold years ahead. How cool would it be to see some dude you have never met wearing your design. Pretty mint.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Design Requirements:</strong><br />
<br />
Ok, so you have skills, but do you have skills with vectors? Don't know what they are? Google them. Basically, they're a type of line that can be resized without losing quality. The average photoshop design uses pixels. What happens when you resize pixels? Your pixels grow in size with your image, rather than creating many more new pixels. This means your image becomes (wait for it)....... PIXELATED and the quality goes to poo. If the printing company needs to print your image on a hoodie, they'll need the best possible quality image they can have. That's why it's best to design from scratch in Adobe Illustrator or Correl Draw or something like that using vectors. If you're unsure, contact a printing company and see what they usually require <img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Competition Clauses:</strong><br />
<br />
- I'm not going to hand over $200 to just any old design, so this competition may have NO winner if the folk at ACL aren't happy with what we're shown. <br />
- If the design is awesome, but not in the right format, then I still can't award you a winner. <br />
- The design will be judged by ACL staff, based on the opinions shown in the ACL forums.<br />
- The deadline will be March 7th 2011<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style='font-size: 21px;'><span style='color: #FF0000'>HAPPY DESIGNING !!</span></span>]]></description>

		<title>ACL FFA R1 - Results Announced</title>

Blaze wins ACL's first Halo:Reach FFA Circuit event !!<br />
<br />
Final Rankings Here<br />
<br />
Report by Peteh:<br />
<br />
Gamers from all over Australia and New Zealand rallied to their Xbox stations for the inaugural ACL Halo: Reach Online FFA tournament. After an impressive showing in Brisbane, ACL veterans Benno and Codestar were heavily favoured to take it out. However, with many new faces amongst the ranks of competitors, it was anybody's day to grab the top spot.<br />
<br />
Round 1 kicked off and as expected, Benno and Hax jumped to a hot start as well as Purple Haze and Injustice who surprised their pools with dominant displays. In the other pools, Dactro, Royalfan, Blaze, Funky, Bald, Peteh, Overuled, D Lord and Simplistiq took the top spots on the way to Round 2.<br />
Round 2 saw Simmo, Blaze and Peteh dominate their pools while Hax out-placed Ripped by a single kill in Pool C and Purple Haze ousted Suiciddee by one in Pool A. Due to a poor first round showing by Codestar, he was matched up with Benno in Round 2 and the ex-teammates dominated Pool B with +17 and +19 spreads respectively. Pool D was outrageously tight, Arby out-placed Overuled with a better K/D as they both finished with 50 kills, Tolaez was only a single kill behind the two of them.<br />
<br />
Round 3 got started and the Top 32 players battled it out for a spot in the semi finals. As expected, Codestar took out a tight Pool A and Benno cruised to a win in Pool B. Suiciddee tore apart the other competitors in Pool C to win by an impressive 15 kills while Dactro ran Pool D in a similar fashion.<br />
The semi-finals arrived and it was no surprise that Benno took out Semi A, followed by Simplistiq, Hax and Bald. Semi B was a tight affair, Codestar and Blaze both sitting on 55 kills. Codestar took out the top spot though with a dominant +25 spread. The Top 8 was rounded out by Toddles and Injustice who finished 3rd and 4th in Semi B.<br />
<br />
The Top 8 players duked it out in the finals and after a day of solid placements, Blaze ran away with a 9 kill win after 15 minutes. Codestar came in at second with 49 kills, Benno hot on his heels at third with 48 of his own.<br />
Congratulations to Blaze for winning ACL's first Online FFA tournament as well as the rest of the Top 8 for coming so far. Thank you to all competitors for providing a fun and exciting tournament, we hope to see you all in our Round 1 Reach 4v4 tournament mid-December!<br />
<br />
Vanzo's final word<br />
<br />
Thanks guys for competing in what was a very successful first event. We know there were some issues, largely with the site, that slowed down how smoothly the event ran. Thanks for your patience and hopefully you all enjoyed playing!<br />
<br />
Full statistics will be released when Stats Central v3 is relaunched to accommodate the new circuit events. A sneak peak reveals these awards based on RAW figures (not averages per game).<br />
<br />
Highest K/D: Codestar<br />
Most Kills: Blaze<br />
Most Assists: Benno/Toddles]]></description>

<br />
ACL is pleased to announce Shockz' Montage!<br />
<br />
As the first project for Asikk under the ACLPro Montage Editor moniker, Shockz has demonstrated his natural ability at the game that was Halo 3. Rising to prowess with the open bracket team 'Outbreak' in 2009, then solidifying his reputation as a strong player his team BOSS finished 3rd in Melbourne in 2010.<br />
<br />
It is with great pleasure that we announce this quick, energetic montage from Asikk and Shockz.<br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.com/v/lUNYaLXzy88"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://youtube.com/v/lUNYaLXzy88" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="640" height="390"></embed></object></span><br />
<br />
On a final note, ACL would also like to welcome Firehawk to the Montage editing team. This will allow you some options and alternatives with your montage service. <br />

<br />
This news announcement will be released in two stages. First of all, we'd like to announce:<br />

		<title>New Hosting - Donation Drive</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/new-hosting-donation-drive-r13</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
I'll make this brief and to the point. ACL's current host is horrible. It can no longer handle the load that our users put on it, and crashes repeatedly causing timeouts, triple posts and just plain, limited access.<br />
<br />
This is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Nothing pains me more to see our beloved site and community hindered, and prevented from growth due to these difficulties. Add to this ACL's plan for expansion and it's clear we need to move host NOW.<br />
<br />
So what can YOU do about it?<br />
<br />
We know what kind of hosting solution we need now, and unfortunately it ain't cheap. We're looking in the region of $80-$120 a month for a suitable hosting plan with more bandwidth, faster processors, more RAM and a bit more prevention from DDoS attacks. This is too much for one man alone, and even for some of the committed staff who've donated already (thanks Pan and Hooters).<br />
<br />
ACL needs your help.<br />
<br />
If you can spare $5, $10, anything to help to upgrade our host, you will benefit. This site needs 100% uptime. Not only will you be able to access the forums without fear of them being down, but us as admins will be able to provide more regular content. I've gone to access the site 3 times this week in hope of uploading some FFA results to make a page, and haven't had access. That's disgusting because I can't even put up the results of one of my competitions on my own site.<br />
<br />
I'm hindered, you're hindered.<br />
<br />
Please, help us make ACL grow, donate now.<br />
<br />
DONATE HERE, NOW]]></description>

		<title>Timeout with Fade</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/timeout-with-fade-r22</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/images/aclsticker.png' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>This week Beware from ACL sits down with Fade.  Fade has found success early in the 2011 Season, with a 3rd Place FFA success under his belt and now a Online Tournament win, look out for him to be a big name this year.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong><strong class='bbc'></span> Thanks for Joining us Fade. So lets start this off with a bit about yourself!<br />
</strong><br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Gamertag:</span></strong> nE Fade <br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>State:</span></strong> QLD<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Current Team:</strong></span> New Era - nE Fade, NATUR4L TAL3NT, GodLikE ProDG, Suiciddee<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Favourite Gametype:</span></strong> Sanctuary 3 Flag<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Controller Settings:</span></strong> Bumper Jumper, 5 Sensitivity<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Hobbies:</span></strong> Basketball, Music, Chilling with mates, Gaming, Going out/Drinking with mates.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> So how long have you been gaming? Additionally, how long have you been playing Halo titles competitively?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span style='color: #0000FF'>Fade:</span></strong> Since I can remember, played H2 hard but only started going serious near end of Halo 3.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> So lets look back to the BrisLAN '10 Finals, ACL's first Reach FFA event. You yourself made it all the way through the heavy competition to the Finals and ended up placing 3rd, tieing 2nd but placing 3rd by k/d and only being one kill off the winner (Benno). How did it feel to be so close to winning? and how did you feel about your performance?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> It was good to see I could get a good placing in reach especially cause it was a FFA which is/was my weak-point. In the warm up round of the FFA I was dead last but I don't know I guess I got use to the monitor and adjusted to how other people were playing and ended up pulling it out looking back now though I bet I would look pretty bad.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/uploads/1286492118/gallery_17_16837.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /><br />
<span class='bbc_center'>Fade accepting his prize money for placing Third at the BrisLAN Finals in the first ever Reach FFA Competition.</strong></span></span><br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> So would you consider yourself an FFA player? Or is Reach just your game?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> Nah FFA was and still is my weak-point. I guess I just picked it up quicker than most in time for the FFA. And yeah I wouldn’t say Its 'my game' but I guess my R1 result shows I'm definitely not struggling.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> Now onto ACL Round 1. Going into the tournament nE picked up Godlike, a very experienced and talented player, but you also picked up Suicide, a new up and coming player who made a name for himself placing 10th in our first ACL FFA Online Round. How did you know these two players were the right fit for New Era? And what did they bring to the team?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> First off I saw Suiciddee in a couple of customs, played with him a lot and realised he was a great slayer, was easy to work with, clicked well and had massive potential. So we now had three in a team and were looking into picking up a potential fourth we had lined up however as soon as we got word that Godlike was interested, we immediately trialled him and worked out that he was the missing piece. Suicidde brought another dominant Slayer and Godlike brought his experience and tactical ability.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> So everyone will no doubt know your team New Era placed first in our first ever Reach 4v4 Online Round. Congratulations to yourself and your teammates. Not only did you guys win, you guys seemed to have won rather handily, only dropping 1 game throughout the entire Pro Bracket. What do you think lead to such a dominant performance by nE?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> We had a lot of Strats worked out, we were pretty well practised for only being a team for three short weeks but we also had a lot of natural team chemistry which helped a  great deal. And in the end we were all players that didn’t care for the Stats we only cared about the end result. I also feel that our communication contributed to our "dominant performance".<br />
 <br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> What do you think of MLG settings of Reach so far? Obviously the settings are still in the early stages only being upto v2, but what do you like and dislike about MLG Reach at the moment? Anything you'd like to see added in v3?<br />
</strong><br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> I would love for any 1 flag to be removed and hopefully some additional maps added in. I think that the addition of sprint was a stroke of genius, it makes the game more fast pace and adds a whole new element to the game. I like the overall feel of MLG, a few minor changes could be made.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> So the core of New Era has been around for a while now, yourself and your brother Natural Talent have always been a strong duo even back in Halo 3. Natural Talent also made it to the Reach FFA Finals in Brisbane as well so he obviously is a great individually talented player. What's it like teaming with your brother? Do you think you two have good chemistry and teamwork that contributed to your success in Round 1?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> We’ve been gaming together since Halo 1 days stacking teams Lan mates on us and still owning, so we have a lot of experience together also we have a sort of natural brother teamwork which gives us a good edge. As for teaming with him we’ve always been good together in a team but until now haven’t found the right mix of team mates to fill the gaps we have which is where Godlike and Suiciddee come in. Yeah our chemistry did contribute but it wasn't just me and talents chemistry it was the fact that we found two more players that have a play styles that compliment our play style and vice versa. <br />
<br />
<span class='bbc_center'><img src='http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/uploads/1286492078/gallery_17_113872.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /></span><br />
<strong class='bbc'><span class='bbc_center'>The BrisLAN FFA Finals, Fade at the closet Table and Talent at the furthermost table playing amongst the other Top 8 Finalists.</span> </strong><br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> With an Online Tournament win under your belt now what does the future hold for New Era? Do you think you guys will stick together for the rest of the Season? Or was this a once off team?</strong><br />
 <br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> This was initially a trial team to begin that we put together for Round 1, but after our first place finish we’ve all decided to stick it out in the long run. 'If it ain’t broken, don't fix it'.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> Any local Brisbane players will know yourself and Nautral Talent attend local Lans, and obviously you two made an appearance for the BrisLAN finals, but do you think with such a strong team we can see you boys and the rest of your team travelling interstate for the 2011 Season?<br />
</strong><br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> I will be attending most/all of the Lans even if its not with the full team and I believe Talent will be attending at least the major events such as Melbourne and Sydney and depending on dates undecided on the rest.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> Congratulations again on the Round 1 win, any shoutouts?<br />
</strong><br />
<span style='color: #0000FF'><strong class='bbc'>Fade:</strong></span> Obviously to ACL for all their work. To Asik and his team, HUGE improvement after Round 1 (team to watch out for) and vTRauMaTiiZeD cause it was his birthday recently.<br />
<br />
<span style='color: #FFA500'><strong class='bbc'>ACL:</strong></span><strong class='bbc'> Thanks for your time!</strong>]]></description>

		<title>MLG Network</title>
		<link>http://www.aclpro.com.au/_/acl-news/mlg-network-r20</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Today MLG have launched their new network, with the old mlgpro.com front of shop, being replaced with the new <a href='http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>www.majorleaguegaming.com</a> site. As well as the new front page, the network consists of GameBattles, mlgTV, ProCircuit, MLG Community and more. Go check it out and have a look around for yourselves.<br />
<br />
<em class='bbc'>"Welcome to the New MLG Network<br />
<br />
What you are looking at now is the first phase of the new MLG Network. Take a look around; there’s already a lot to see. Everything is a lot faster, shinier, and easier to navigate. We're really excited to show it off, and even more excited about what lies in store for 2011."</em><br />
<br />
It also sounds like they have something similar (but different) to ACL's <a href='http://www.aclpro.com.au/aclstatscentral/' class='bbc_url' title=''>Stats Central</a> planned for before the 2011 season...<br />
<br />
"<em class='bbc'>We are really excited that the new platform is out, because it allows us to add new features more quickly and easily. As such, we’ve launched it before adding every last feature we eventually plan to include. You will surely notice that there are several missing or incomplete features. Plans are already in the works to add in a bunch of the things you’ve come to expect from the Pro Circuit Site, as well as some new features that will enable you to follow and interact with the Pro Circuit in new ways. Here’s a quick rundown of what will be added to the site before the 2011 Pro Circuit Season kicks off:<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sortable leaderboards</strong>: Check out the stats from every tournament and sort by any criteria we have collected stats for.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Standings pages</strong>: Who ranks where on the Pro Circuit? Who are the official MLG pros in each game? Find out on the upgraded Standings pages.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Pro Circuit archive</strong>: Easily look up results of any tournament in MLG’s illustrious history. If we have stats from that tournament, you can check out those too. You’ll also be able to easily access any videos and news articles from that tournament, all in one place.</em>"]]></description>

		<title>ACL 2010 Halo 3 - Stats Central Awards</title>

<br />
ACL presents the 2010 Halo 3 Awards!<br />
<br />
ACL is pleased to announce the winners of the Halo 3 Awards for the 2010 season. This year marks the first ever national circuit in Halo's 9 year history, and what a year it has been. These awards are based on two major categories, the Pro Choice awards and the Stats Central Awards. The former is based on the upper echelon's opinions of who were the top players in the circuit this year while the latter quite clearly looks at how individuals performed over the season according to their in game statistics.<br />
<br />
The Pro Choice Awards were released on the 25th of November and can be found HERE.<br />
<br />
The Stat Central Awards have been divided into three catagories:<br />
<br />
Pro Division<br />
<br />
Semi-Pro Division<br />
<br />
Amateur Division<br />
<br />
Each division has two sections:<br />
<br />
Individual awards: These are based on points from the entire 2010 season.<br />
<br />
Pro = Individual Player Rank: 1-32<br />
Semi-Pro = Individual Player Rank: 33-64<br />
Amateur = Individual Player Rank: 65+<br />
<br />
Team awards: These awards are based on SINGLE events and the division the team is in is based on where the team placed at that particular LAN*.<br />
<br />
Pro = Top 4<br />
Semi-Pro = Top 8<br />
Amateur = Outside of Top 8<br />
<br />
*Teams may change divisions dependent on which LAN they receive the award at, ie. No Remorse placing 2nd at Melbourne makes them eligible for Pro Team awards for that LAN. No Remorse's 5th placing at Sydney makes them eligible for Semi-Pro Awards based on their stats from that tournament.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to those winners!]]></description>
