**This week Beware from ACL sits down with Fade.  Fade has found success early in the 2011 Season, with a 3rd Place FFA success under his belt and now a Online Tournament win, look out for him to be a big name this year.**





**ACL:**
**** Thanks for Joining us Fade. So lets start this off with a bit about yourself!






**Gamertag:**
 nE Fade 



**State:**
 QLD



**Current Team:** New Era - nE Fade, NATUR4L TAL3NT, GodLikE ProDG, Suiciddee



**Favourite Gametype:**
 Sanctuary 3 Flag



**Controller Settings:**
 Bumper Jumper, 5 Sensitivity



**Hobbies:**
 Basketball, Music, Chilling with mates, Gaming, Going out/Drinking with mates.






**ACL:****So how long have you been gaming? Additionally, how long have you been playing Halo titles competitively?**






**Fade:**
 Since I can remember, played H2 hard but only started going serious near end of Halo 3.






**ACL:****So lets look back to the BrisLAN '10 Finals, ACL's first Reach FFA event. You yourself made it all the way through the heavy competition to the Finals and ended up placing 3rd, tieing 2nd but placing 3rd by k/d and only being one kill off the winner (Benno). How did it feel to be so close to winning? and how did you feel about your performance?**






**Fade:** It was good to see I could get a good placing in reach especially cause it was a FFA which is/was my weak-point. In the warm up round of the FFA I was dead last but I don't know I guess I got use to the monitor and adjusted to how other people were playing and ended up pulling it out looking back now though I bet I would look pretty bad.

**ACL:****So would you consider yourself an FFA player? Or is Reach just your game?**






**Fade:** Nah FFA was and still is my weak-point. I guess I just picked it up quicker than most in time for the FFA. And yeah I wouldn’t say Its 'my game' but I guess my R1 result shows I'm definitely not struggling.






**ACL:****Now onto ACL Round 1. Going into the tournament nE picked up Godlike, a very experienced and talented player, but you also picked up Suicide, a new up and coming player who made a name for himself placing 10th in our first ACL FFA Online Round. How did you know these two players were the right fit for New Era? And what did they bring to the team?**






**Fade:** First off I saw Suiciddee in a couple of customs, played with him a lot and realised he was a great slayer, was easy to work with, clicked well and had massive potential. So we now had three in a team and were looking into picking up a potential fourth we had lined up however as soon as we got word that Godlike was interested, we immediately trialled him and worked out that he was the missing piece. Suicidde brought another dominant Slayer and Godlike brought his experience and tactical ability.






**ACL:****So everyone will no doubt know your team New Era placed first in our first ever Reach 4v4 Online Round. Congratulations to yourself and your teammates. Not only did you guys win, you guys seemed to have won rather handily, only dropping 1 game throughout the entire Pro Bracket. What do you think lead to such a dominant performance by nE?**






**Fade:** We had a lot of Strats worked out, we were pretty well practised for only being a team for three short weeks but we also had a lot of natural team chemistry which helped a  great deal. And in the end we were all players that didn’t care for the Stats we only cared about the end result. I also feel that our communication contributed to our "dominant performance".


 



**ACL:****What do you think of MLG settings of Reach so far? Obviously the settings are still in the early stages only being upto v2, but what do you like and dislike about MLG Reach at the moment? Anything you'd like to see added in v3?**



**Fade:** I would love for any 1 flag to be removed and hopefully some additional maps added in. I think that the addition of sprint was a stroke of genius, it makes the game more fast pace and adds a whole new element to the game. I like the overall feel of MLG, a few minor changes could be made.






**ACL:****So the core of New Era has been around for a while now, yourself and your brother Natural Talent have always been a strong duo even back in Halo 3. Natural Talent also made it to the Reach FFA Finals in Brisbane as well so he obviously is a great individually talented player. What's it like teaming with your brother? Do you think you two have good chemistry and teamwork that contributed to your success in Round 1?**






**Fade:** We’ve been gaming together since Halo 1 days stacking teams Lan mates on us and still owning, so we have a lot of experience together also we have a sort of natural brother teamwork which gives us a good edge. As for teaming with him we’ve always been good together in a team but until now haven’t found the right mix of team mates to fill the gaps we have which is where Godlike and Suiciddee come in. Yeah our chemistry did contribute but it wasn't just me and talents chemistry it was the fact that we found two more players that have a play styles that compliment our play style and vice versa.

**ACL:****With an Online Tournament win under your belt now what does the future hold for New Era? Do you think you guys will stick together for the rest of the Season? Or was this a once off team?**


 



**Fade:** This was initially a trial team to begin that we put together for Round 1, but after our first place finish we’ve all decided to stick it out in the long run. 'If it ain’t broken, don't fix it'.






**ACL:****Any local Brisbane players will know yourself and Nautral Talent attend local Lans, and obviously you two made an appearance for the BrisLAN finals, but do you think with such a strong team we can see you boys and the rest of your team travelling interstate for the 2011 Season?**



**Fade:** I will be attending most/all of the Lans even if its not with the full team and I believe Talent will be attending at least the major events such as Melbourne and Sydney and depending on dates undecided on the rest.






**ACL:****Congratulations again on the Round 1 win, any shoutouts?**



**Fade:** Obviously to ACL for all their work. To Asik and his team, HUGE improvement after Round 1 (team to watch out for) and vTRauMaTiiZeD cause it was his birthday recently.






**ACL:****Thanks for your time!**
