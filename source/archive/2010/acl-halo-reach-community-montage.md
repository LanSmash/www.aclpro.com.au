Submit your clips now for the community montage now!








Asikk and Doofus will be editing a community Halo:Reach montage for release in January 2011. This will be an Australian and New Zealand Community montage supported by ACL Showcasing the best of the best clips from Australia and NZ.








What you need to do:





Upload your 'MLG' clip to your file share and either post in this thread, or send my xbl gamer tag 'IM ASiKK' a message telling me what the name of the clip(s) is.


You will also have to tell me exactly how you want your name spelled in the montage.





At the moment, the current clip restriction is 2 clips per person. If there is a lack of submissions, more clips will be accepted.





The cut off date to be considered is 25/12/2010.





Thanks
