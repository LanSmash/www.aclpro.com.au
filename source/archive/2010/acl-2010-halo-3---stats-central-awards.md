ACL presents the 2010 Halo 3 Awards!





ACL is pleased to announce the winners of the Halo 3 Awards for the 2010 season. This year marks the first ever national circuit in Halo's 9 year history, and what a year it has been. These awards are based on two major categories, the Pro Choice awards and the Stats Central Awards. The former is based on the upper echelon's opinions of who were the top players in the circuit this year while the latter quite clearly looks at how individuals performed over the season according to their in game statistics.





The Pro Choice Awards were released on the 25th of November and can be found HERE.





The Stat Central Awards have been divided into three catagories:





Pro Division





Semi-Pro Division





Amateur Division





Each division has two sections:





Individual awards: These are based on points from the entire 2010 season.





Pro = Individual Player Rank: 1-32


Semi-Pro = Individual Player Rank: 33-64


Amateur = Individual Player Rank: 65+





Team awards: These awards are based on SINGLE events and the division the team is in is based on where the team placed at that particular LAN*.





Pro = Top 4


Semi-Pro = Top 8


Amateur = Outside of Top 8





*Teams may change divisions dependent on which LAN they receive the award at, ie. No Remorse placing 2nd at Melbourne makes them eligible for Pro Team awards for that LAN. No Remorse's 5th placing at Sydney makes them eligible for Semi-Pro Awards based on their stats from that tournament.





Congratulations to those winners!
