Hi Guys,





I'll make this brief and to the point. ACL's current host is horrible. It can no longer handle the load that our users put on it, and crashes repeatedly causing timeouts, triple posts and just plain, limited access.





This is unacceptable.





Nothing pains me more to see our beloved site and community hindered, and prevented from growth due to these difficulties. Add to this ACL's plan for expansion and it's clear we need to move host NOW.





So what can YOU do about it?





We know what kind of hosting solution we need now, and unfortunately it ain't cheap. We're looking in the region of $80-$120 a month for a suitable hosting plan with more bandwidth, faster processors, more RAM and a bit more prevention from DDoS attacks. This is too much for one man alone, and even for some of the committed staff who've donated already (thanks Pan and Hooters).





ACL needs your help.





If you can spare $5, $10, anything to help to upgrade our host, you will benefit. This site needs 100% uptime. Not only will you be able to access the forums without fear of them being down, but us as admins will be able to provide more regular content. I've gone to access the site 3 times this week in hope of uploading some FFA results to make a page, and haven't had access. That's disgusting because I can't even put up the results of one of my competitions on my own site.





I'm hindered, you're hindered.





Please, help us make ACL grow, donate now.
