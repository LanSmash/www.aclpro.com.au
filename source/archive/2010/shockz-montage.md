ACL is pleased to announce Shockz' Montage!





As the first project for Asikk under the ACLPro Montage Editor moniker, Shockz has demonstrated his natural ability at the game that was Halo 3. Rising to prowess with the open bracket team 'Outbreak' in 2009, then solidifying his reputation as a strong player his team BOSS finished 3rd in Melbourne in 2010.





It is with great pleasure that we announce this quick, energetic montage from Asikk and Shockz.











On a final note, ACL would also like to welcome Firehawk to the Montage editing team. This will allow you some options and alternatives with your montage service.
