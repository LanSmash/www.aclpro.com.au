ACL presents the 2010 Halo 3 Awards!





ACL is pleased to announce the winners of the Halo 3 Awards for the 2010 season. This year marks the first ever national circuit in Halo's 9 year history, and what a year it has been. These awards are based on two major categories, the Pro Choice awards and the Stats Central Awards. The former is based on the upper echelon's opinions of who were the top players in the circuit this year while the latter quite clearly looks at how individuals performed over the season according to their in game statistics.





This news announcement will be released in two stages. First of all, we'd like to announce:





The Pro Choice Awards - 2010





Congratulations to those winners!





In the next few days you can expect to see the Stats Central Awards announced.
