Final Rankings Here





Report by Peteh:





Gamers from all over Australia and New Zealand rallied to their Xbox stations for the inaugural ACL Halo: Reach Online FFA tournament. After an impressive showing in Brisbane, ACL veterans Benno and Codestar were heavily favoured to take it out. However, with many new faces amongst the ranks of competitors, it was anybody's day to grab the top spot.





Round 1 kicked off and as expected, Benno and Hax jumped to a hot start as well as Purple Haze and Injustice who surprised their pools with dominant displays. In the other pools, Dactro, Royalfan, Blaze, Funky, Bald, Peteh, Overuled, D Lord and Simplistiq took the top spots on the way to Round 2.


Round 2 saw Simmo, Blaze and Peteh dominate their pools while Hax out-placed Ripped by a single kill in Pool C and Purple Haze ousted Suiciddee by one in Pool A. Due to a poor first round showing by Codestar, he was matched up with Benno in Round 2 and the ex-teammates dominated Pool B with +17 and +19 spreads respectively. Pool D was outrageously tight, Arby out-placed Overuled with a better K/D as they both finished with 50 kills, Tolaez was only a single kill behind the two of them.





Round 3 got started and the Top 32 players battled it out for a spot in the semi finals. As expected, Codestar took out a tight Pool A and Benno cruised to a win in Pool B. Suiciddee tore apart the other competitors in Pool C to win by an impressive 15 kills while Dactro ran Pool D in a similar fashion.


The semi-finals arrived and it was no surprise that Benno took out Semi A, followed by Simplistiq, Hax and Bald. Semi B was a tight affair, Codestar and Blaze both sitting on 55 kills. Codestar took out the top spot though with a dominant +25 spread. The Top 8 was rounded out by Toddles and Injustice who finished 3rd and 4th in Semi B.





The Top 8 players duked it out in the finals and after a day of solid placements, Blaze ran away with a 9 kill win after 15 minutes. Codestar came in at second with 49 kills, Benno hot on his heels at third with 48 of his own.


Congratulations to Blaze for winning ACL's first Online FFA tournament as well as the rest of the Top 8 for coming so far. Thank you to all competitors for providing a fun and exciting tournament, we hope to see you all in our Round 1 Reach 4v4 tournament mid-December!
