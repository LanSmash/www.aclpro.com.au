Today MLG have launched their new network, with the old mlgpro.com front of shop, being replaced with the new 
[www.majorleaguegaming.com](http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/) site. As well as the new front page, the network consists of GameBattles, mlgTV, ProCircuit, MLG Community and more. Go check it out and have a look around for yourselves.






"Welcome to the New MLG Network





What you are looking at now is the first phase of the new MLG Network. Take a look around; there’s already a lot to see. Everything is a lot faster, shinier, and easier to navigate. We're really excited to show it off, and even more excited about what lies in store for 2011."




It also sounds like they have something similar (but different) to ACL's 
[Stats Central](http://www.aclpro.com.au/aclstatscentral/) planned for before the 2011 season...

We are really excited that the new platform is out, because it allows us to add new features more quickly and easily. As such, we’ve launched it before adding every last feature we eventually plan to include. You will surely notice that there are several missing or incomplete features. Plans are already in the works to add in a bunch of the things you’ve come to expect from the Pro Circuit Site, as well as some new features that will enable you to follow and interact with the Pro Circuit in new ways. Here’s a quick rundown of what will be added to the site before the 2011 Pro Circuit Season kicks off:






**Sortable leaderboards**
: Check out the stats from every tournament and sort by any criteria we have collected stats for.






**Standings pages**
: Who ranks where on the Pro Circuit? Who are the official MLG pros in each game? Find out on the upgraded Standings pages.






**Pro Circuit archive**
: Easily look up results of any tournament in MLG’s illustrious history. If we have stats from that tournament, you can check out those too. You’ll also be able to easily access any videos and news articles from that tournament, all in one place."
