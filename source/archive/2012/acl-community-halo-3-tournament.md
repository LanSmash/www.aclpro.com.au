**ACL Community Halo 3 MLG Tournament!**





**Fresh off the launch of ACL Community we are pleased to announce the second ACL Community tournament of 2012 with a blast from the past! Thats right, you read correct, one of the most popular console titles ever is making a return to ACL for the weekend. Don't miss your chance to play Halo 3 just like we did back in 2007-2010 with the rest of the Australian and New Zealand community.**





**Details**

How do ACL Community tournaments vary from ACL Online Rounds? ACL Community tournaments are purely for fun! There are no valuable season points to be earned, just a chance to sign up to play with some mates or your team in a tournament filled the perfect mix of competitive and social fun!






**When**

Saturday the 4th of February and Sunday the 5th of February. 






**Pool Play**
 - Saturday the 4th of February



**Double Elimination**
 - Sunday the 5th of February. 






**TIMES**

4th February - 2pm (AEST)


5th February - 11am (AEST)






**Structure**


**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Pool Play will be run on Saturday the 4th of February. All Pool Play matches must be competed by Saturday night. Each Pool will have (TBA - usually between 4-6) teams, this is dependent on registration numbers and could change. Each series teams MUST play ALL 3 games and there is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.






**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16. If teams opt to not play Placements Rounds then their final placing will be determined by their seeds from Pool Play.
