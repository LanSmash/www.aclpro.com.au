**More exciting news for 2012? Introducing ACL Community!**





**As if 2012 wasn't already action-packed here at ACL, today we are proud to announced another new aspect of competition here at ACL in the form of ACL Community! Those who have hung around the forums long enough will remember 'Weekend Warriors' back in the days of Halo 3, well think of ACL Community as a huge step up, as we really kick social gaming into gear here for 2012. ACL Community tournaments will be run over all our supported titles, as well as a multitude of other games that arenâ€™t on our ACL Pro Circuit. This will provide you guys at home with more fun competitions throughout the year and give you a chance to play in different types of tournaments that you may never have seen before. While these tournaments may be more social and less serious then our regular tournaments, they will still be run as well and as professionally as the tournaments you are used to from ACL.**





**More Details**

ACL Community tournaments will be typically be run over a dedicated weekend and will be hosted twice a month by ACL Staff.


These tournaments will range from titles you are familiar with being played in competitions such as Reach, MW3 and Fifa to games you may never have played in tournament environment before such as Battlefield 3, Forza, NBA and a whole lot more!


ACL Community tournaments will be hosted by ACL Staff members who will provide a very structured and organised tournament while allowing you to unwind and have an enjoyable gaming session.

This can vary from feedback on our tournaments, ideas and suggestions about future competitions and even open to the idea of community members running ACL Community tournaments themselves. Whatever you want to tell us, we welcome your opinions, so don't be shy!
