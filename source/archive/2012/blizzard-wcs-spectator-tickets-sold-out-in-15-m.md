**Fans of Starcraft are left to gather themselves after the excitement of snatching up their spectator tickets for the Blizzard World Championship Series Australian Nationals and Oceania Finals.**




A total of 600 spectator tickets, 300 each for Saturday and Sunday, were available for free as of 9am today from ACL’s website. Needless to say, the tickets were eagerly anticipated by fans of Starcraft from all around the country and it’s easy to see why.





16 of Australia’s best Starcraft gamers including household names Moonglade, Pig and Mafia, as well as former Starcraft: Brood War Pro Legionnaire, will go head to head during the Australian Nationals on Friday and Saturday 10-11 August. At the conclusion of the Australian Nationals, the top 6 players will go through to meet the 2 of New Zealand’s finest gamers to face off in the Oceanic Finals.





The Australian Nationals have a cool $10,000USD Prize Pool, so a lot is at stake. The 8 players who made it through to the Oceania Finals will then compete for their share of a whopping $15,000USD prize money on Sunday August 12. Not only does the winner get to roll in their share of the cash, but they also get their shot to take on the best in the world as they will qualify for the Blizzard World Championship Series Finals to be held in China later in the year.





It’s shaping up to be quite an event, with not only Australia’s best players but also the World’s best casters and commentators in attendance. The “Casting Archon” Tastosis, arguably the world’s most renowned Starcraft casting duo, along with HD&PainUser, two of the USA’s greatest casters will be attending the event to help bring you the most entertaining and highest quality stream possible. The event will also be MC’d by our very own Maynarde.
