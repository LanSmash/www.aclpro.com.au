**Structure**



**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. This is dependent on registration numbers and could change.


Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.





Pool play gametypes will look like this - CTF, S&D, CTF.





There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.






**Invite Pool Play**
 - Top 4 ranked teams based off 2012 season points.



**Open Pool Play**
 - Everyone outside the top 4 teams.





Pool Play will consist of several Open Pools and one Invite Pool (based off of 2012 season points). Teams will go head to head on Saturday the 9th of June in Pool Play to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on Sunday the 10th of June. The top 14 teams by win/loss ratio after Open Pool Play will progress to the Double Elimination bracket in places 5-16. The Invite Pool Play teams will be placed into spots 1-4 in the Double Elimination bracket after the results of their Invite Pool Play matches.






**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16. If you do not show up to your Placement Rounds you forfeit your chance of earning the best possible result for your team. Double elimination will occur Sunday and be played out all day until a winner is found. 





Double elimination map rotation - CTF, S&D, CTF, S&D, CTF.
