**ACL Partners With Frag Labs!**





**ACL is pleased to announce a partnership with Frag Labs, an up and coming source of some of the best gaming PCs available. From custom solutions to powerful laptops, Frag Labs deliver quality high performance gaming machines. To celebrate this partnership, the team at Frag Labs have offered 16 of their gaming laptops, the Vector models by Horize, for use at ACL's first stop of the 2012 season, the Gold Coast Nationals.

Australia's best Starcraft 2 players including m00nGlaDe, Rossi, Iaguz, PiG and many more will be vying for the title of ACL's first national winner and there is no better way to do that than on Horize's awesome laptops thanks to Frag Labs.
