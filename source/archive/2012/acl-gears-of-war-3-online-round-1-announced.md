**ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 Announced**





**Here at ACL we are proud to announce something very special - Gears 3 has been added officially to our 2012 Pro Circuit !! This means that ACL staff will be dedicated to running both online competitions and live events for the Gears community. This support will see GOW 3 players side by side with the biggest competitive titles in the world at ACL events, sharing time on the main stage and a full quality production live stream. At the moment the first Gears National Live Event will take place in Sydney in April.





To celebrate, our Gears of War 3 Admin Midnite has organised the first Gears Online Round of 2012! February will play host to an awesome free to play tournament with some sweet prizes including $400 cash. Midnite has been fortunate enough to secure some special guest commentators to cast some of the matches over the weekend. 
[@VeroProDiGY](http://www.twitter.com/VeroProDiGY), a MLG Gears Coach and 
[@Falloutt](http://www.twitter.com/Falloutt), a former Gears 1/2 Pro Player, will join us for the tournament.





So thanks to the Gears fans for a tedious wait, but it is with great pleasure we announce this today. We look forward to supporting you in 2012!!  - ACL CEO: Vanz**

**What’re we playing for?**


We’ve been working hard to secure some sweet prizes for the Gears Online Round. So far we’ve got Character DLC codes, a couple of games and most importantly $400.






**Structure**





**Pool Play – Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have (tba – usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.


Each series MUST plan ALL 3 games.


There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine the next stage.





Teams will go head to head on Friday the 10th and finishing on Saturday the 11th of February in a Round Robin tournament to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on both Saturday the 11th and Sunday the 12 of February.






**Double Elimination – Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs earlier.  Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement rounds will determine the Overall Points for your placing.





Double Elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all the tiebreakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed in the DE bracket to fight it out to for the top spot and the prizes that go alongside it.


Double Elimination gameplay will commence straight after the last pool play matches have been 


played on Saturday the 10th and will run through to Sunday the 11th of February.
