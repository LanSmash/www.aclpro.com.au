**Structure:**


**Pool Play – Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. 


Each series MUST plan ALL 3 games.


There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine the next stage.






**Double Elimination – Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs earlier.  Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement rounds will determine the Overall Points for your placing.





Double Elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all the tiebreakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed in the DE bracket to fight it out to for the top spot and the prizes that go alongside it.
