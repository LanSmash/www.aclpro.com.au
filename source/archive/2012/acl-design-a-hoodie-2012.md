We're making a call for all designers out there to get creative and make a new design for us in 2012. I can have GFX fail (above banner supplied by me). Not only will you win $200, but you'll have your handywork on every supporting member's hot gaming bod for many cold years ahead. How cool would it be to see some dude you have never met wearing your design. Pretty mint.












**Design Requirements:**





Ok, so you have skills, but do you have skills with vectors? Don't know what they are? Google them. Basically, they're a type of line that can be resized without losing quality. The average photoshop design uses pixels. What happens when you resize pixels? Your pixels grow in size with your image, rather than creating many more new pixels. This means your image becomes (wait for it)....... PIXELATED and the quality goes to poo. If the printing company needs to print your image on a hoodie, they'll need the best possible quality image they can have. That's why it's best to design from scratch in Adobe Illustrator or Correl Draw or something like that using vectors. If you're unsure, contact a printing company and see what they usually require

**Competition Clauses:**





- We are not going to hand over $200 to just any old design, so this competition may have NO winner if the folk at ACL aren't happy with what we're shown. 


- If the design is awesome, but not in the right format, then I still can't award you a winner. 


- The design will be judged by ACL staff, based on the opinions shown in the ACL forums.


- Must include ACLPRO.COM.AU, and a place for individual gamertags on the back 


- The deadline will be April 12th 2012, there is no exception to this.
