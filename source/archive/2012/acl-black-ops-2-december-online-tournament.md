**ACL Black Ops 2 December Online Tournament**





**The worlds biggest game has just been released and ACL is proud to announce their first online tournament for this blockbuster game! Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 has been out for less than a month but now its time to see the first real competitive games between the best pro & amateur teams in Australia.**




With Black Ops 2 still in its infancy ACL felt it the perfect opportunity to host our first announced Black Ops 2 competition for December 9th. Leaving roughly the first month for players to get a general feel of the game, we will be able to showcase just what our community can do and to truly test out some of the competitive rule settings and options to set a benchmark for competitive Call of Duty. 






**Details:**

This is not an official ACL online round. This tournament will not be ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 1, and will not award ACL season points. This is the first competitive tournament ACL will be hosting for Black Ops 2 to allow the testing for online structures, the development of understanding with Black ops 2 competitive settings for players and staff, and practice for teams to compete against the best Black Ops 2 players and teams in Australia. Not to forget, they will also be competing for fun and some serious cash & prizes!






**P2P to F2P Tournament:**

This tournament was originally announced as a Pay to Play tournament however we have now changed it to a Free to Play tournament. If there are any players who had already purchased a Pay to Play pass please contact an Admin for a refund.






**Prizes:**

**Day/Time:**

Date: Sunday the 9th December. 


Time: 10:30am AEDT.






**Tournament Structure:**

Unlike typical ACL online rounds, this tournament will host a straight up Double Elimination bracket. This means no pool play will be played for this tournament and all seeding for this tournament will be 100% random. While this is not a indication that future ACL online rounds will also use this structure, it does mean we are testing out this structure and gauging community feedback from the players and teams that compete.






**Streaming/casting:**

The whole tournament will be livestreamed and casted on ACL twitch.tv channel 
[here](http://www.twitch.tv/ACLPro).






**Tournament Settings/Further Details:**

As Black Ops 2 has just recently come out we are unsure at this point in time what settings and maps will be used for this tournament. Rest assured this thread will be updated with further information as time goes on. We are aware that Decerto have released their V1 settings. For now, enjoy the release of Black Ops 2 and get pumped for the first ever ACL Black Ops 2 online tournament! Please be aware that if less than 10 teams register, the tournament will not go ahead.
