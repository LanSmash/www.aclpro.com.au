**Spectating**


As this is the first event we've run in conjunction with a gaming convention, there is a small surcharge for spectating the ACL events. In the past, spectating has been free. To combat this, we have worked out an agreement whereby ACL spectators get 2 days for the price of 1, and access to all parts of the convention.





$15 for 2 days spectator access.






**Parking**


Parking is free and there are numerous parking spaces available. As shown on the map above the recommended parking areas are marked in black.






**Food & Drinks**


The Bond Cafe will be opened on the weekend and can be located across the lake from the venue. Don's Tavern is located directly beneath the venue, but will most likely only be available for drink purchases. Robina Town Shopping center is located a rough 5-10 minute drive away from the venue and has most fast food outlets to accommodate any gamer.
