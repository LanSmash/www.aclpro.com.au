**Blizzard Entertainment announce the 


Starcraft II World Championship Series: Australian National Qualifiers**






**The Australian Cyber League is named primary event partner**





**Blizzard has announced this year's massive contribution to you, the players, to bring you one of the biggest eSports competitions ever held in both Australia and around the globe. ACL is proud to confirm that we will be working closely with Blizzard ANZ to bring you most of the qualifier events as well as the live National and Oceanic Final event later in the year where the best Starcraft 2 Player will be decided.**





Original Blizzard Release can be read 
[**here on their SEA blog**](http://sea.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/231241/World_Championship_Series_-_Oceania_Nationals-4_12_2012#blog).




The Starcraft II World Championship Series consists of tournaments held in nearly every part of the world, bringing players from all over the globe together to compete for pride, glory and prizes.





Starting with National Qualifiers, players will battle it out for a chance to prove they have what it takes to be the best in the country, and qualify for the Oceanic Finals in their part of the world. Then, the winners of the Oceanic Finals will earn a place to fight in the Starcraft World Championship Series, where they’ll compete for not only prizes, but the title of World Champion.





More details about this tournament, along with prize details, will be released in the very near future. In the meantime, the qualifiers are starting very soon, so why not be a part of the action? Here’s a list ACL’s Australian Qualifiers.
