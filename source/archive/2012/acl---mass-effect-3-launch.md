Once again the great folks at EA Australia showed us and the Australian gaming scene why they are one of the most community involved game development companies out there. A few of us from ACL got invited to the launch of their next huge title Mass Effect 3 (which hits shelves on March 8th) at Soho.

We were treated to an extended playable demo of the game, which if you have played the downloadable demo you will know how good this was as we got to play further into the game. There was also a guest appearance by Associate Producer at EA - Robyn Theberge, who gave a short talk about the game and concluded with the newly released extended trailer which if you haven’t seen you simply must have a look at.











If you have been living on mars and have no idea what the Mass Effect series is all about, well you have a few weeks to get up to speed and I suggest you do. The storyline of the series is one of the strongest and deepest out of all the games I have come across. Ever. Without spoiling any of them for you, the tag line for ME3 which I am sure you have heard is “Take Back Earth”. So come March 8th, that’s what will be happening, earth will be taken back by millions of Shepards.





Our hosts for the night were of course Pidgeo and Jiggsy who energetically kept the night rolling with prizes and information. As a team these two are really keeping the community up to date and involved with what EA has in store, not just with ME3 but also with the rest of their upcoming lineup. The support that these two and the rest of EA show ACL, eSports and the Australian gaming community in general is absolutely outstanding. 





I have to mention too that a combination of a green screen, open bar and young adults made for some interesting pictures. Everyone had the opportunity to have their photo taken in front of a green screen and then merged into the body of Shepard (the protagonist of the Mass Effect series). Most did a serious one first up, as who doesn’t want to picture themselves as Shepard. After this though when the queues died down, more and more shall we say, interesting, pictures were taken. I am sure some of them will make an appearance online sometime. So we will have to keep our eyes out for them.

The live music (Sydney CON artists performing Mass Effect 3 tracks), DJs, Cosplayers, free food and open bar made for a great night. Thanks again EA Australia!
