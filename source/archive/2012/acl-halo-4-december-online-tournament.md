**ACL Halo 4 December Online Tournament**





**So who's excited for Halo 4?! With MLG on this weekend and Immunity over in attendance showing off what our community is capable of we thought it would be a perfect opportunity to announce our first Halo 4 Online Tournament for December 1st!**




With the official release date of Halo 4 merely a few short days away and the first few weeks of the release usually consisting of Campaign and Matchmaking domination, Decemeber 1st presents a perfect medium of allowing community members time to get used to the game and settings to develop and the public not having to wait too long for their first ACL online tournament!






**Details:**

This is not an official ACL online round. This tournament will not be ACL Halo 4 Online Round 1, and will not award ACL season points. This is the first competitive tournament ACL will be hosting for Halo 4 to allow the testing for online structures, the development of understanding with Halo 4 competitive settings for players and staff, and practice for teams to compete against the best Halo 4 players and teams in Australia.

Confirmation for this tournament will be enabled a week out from the starting date where all registered teams must post in the Registration/Confirming thread confirming their lineup and attendance for this tournament. Registration and Confirmation will close on Thursday the 29th of November at 11.59pm.






**Day/Time:**


**Date:**
 Saturday the 1st of December.



**Time:**
 11am AEDT.






**Tournament Structure:**


Unlike typical ACL online rounds, this tournament will host a straight up Double Elimination bracket. This means no pool play will be played for this tournament and all seeding for this tournament will be 100% random. While this is not a indication that future ACL online rounds will also use this structure, it does mean we are testing out this structure and gauging community feedback from the players and teams that compete.






**Prizes:**

Thanks to Plantronics, maker of GAMECOM gaming headsets we have some high quality gaming and audio equipment to give away as prizes for this tournament. Also thanks to your friendly neighborhood ACL staff we have put in $500 for first place of this tournament!

Rest assured this thread will be updated with further information as time goes on. For now, enjoy the release of Halo 4 and get pumped for the first ever ACL Halo 4 online tournament!
