**Today Todd from ACL took some time out to have a chat with the winner of the latest FIFA tournament hosted on ACL, The Community Shield. Shadi the Daddi took out Australia's first online FIFA 12 tournament in a dominating fashion.**








**Todd: Cheers for your time Shadi, before we get cracking tell us a bit about yourself.**





**Shadi:**

Name: Shadi


Age: 25


Gamertag: Shadi The Daddy


State: Victoria


Favourite Team: Brazil









**Todd: How long have you been playing for FIFA for? And what got you into it?**





**Shadi:** I've been playing ever since the game was released. I've also played soccer since the age of 7.









**Todd: How did you feel competing in your first ACL competition? Did you have any nerves or any expectations?**





**Shadi:** I was just excited to play, it was my first tournament. I take fifa seriously, so I was really into it.









**Todd: I noticed that you used International teams for every game played during this competition, what was the reason behind that?**





**Shadi:** I feel that when somebody uses Real Madrid, Internationals are the only teams that can beat them. Plus I don’t like using club teams.









**Todd: What were your thoughts after finishing your pool play games with 8 wins and 0 losses?**





**Shadi:** I thought that I was going to win the whole competition. Edxpress was a really tough opponent though; I think I scored in the 90th minute to win one of my games against him.









**Todd: Will you be attending any LANS in the future? What about competing in any more online competitions?**





**Shadi:** I’ll definitely try and attend all of the online rounds, I’ll just have to try and fit in games around my schedule. As for LANS, I’ll try my best to attend the Victorian one.









**Todd: How did you find organizing your games during the week for pool play?**





**Shadi:** I really enjoyed the way it was done, because it meant I was able to play when I was free.









**Todd: Who did you think was your toughest opponent during this competition?**





**Shadi:** I thought Edxpress was a really tough opponent because I only won each game by one goal. I also thought that you were a good opponent to play against because you managed to win a game against me.









**Todd: Thanks for your time Shadi! I hope to see you competing in ACL’s first online round in the coming days!**
