Saturday marks the completion of the Australian Nationals which will crown this year’s best Australian StarCraft II players. Their chance to celebrate will be short lived though as the top six Australian players will clash with the top two New Zealand players in the Oceania Finals on Sunday. The two finalists coming out of the event will then go on to represent the region in the Battle.net World Championship in China later this year.









Entry is free but tickets are limited, so grab a ticket and come on down to show your support for local StarCraft II eSports and cheer your favourite local players on!
