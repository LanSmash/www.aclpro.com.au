**ACL Sydney 2012 - Prizes Announced**





**In December last year, ACL was very excited to announce GAMECOM as the platinum sponsor for our event. GAMECOM have once again stepped up to support us at ACL Sydney, contributing a large portion of the ever-growing Prize Pool and providing the ACL Sydney Mainstage, Starcraft 2 Station and Feature Station with top of the line GAMECOM headsets. They are not alone, as we also see the return of Fraglabs and Horize who are graciously donating their ever popular gaming laptops for our Starcraft 2 competitors to enjoy. Also showing their support at ACL Sydney will be our recently announced sponsor TT eSPORTS, who are providing their high quality gaming peripherals for our Starcraft 2 players to use, while also contributing to the Sydney prize pool. Then our most recently announced sponsor, ASUS, with their partners Nvidia, Kingston, Western Digital and CoolerMaster, will be providing not only 32 monitors and many graphics cards & components for prizes and giveaways, but 10 full-house Gaming PCs. These companies have shown their true dedication in helping to shape the future of the competitive eSports scene in Australia and we are proud to support their quality products. All of these companies create outstanding products in their respected fields and you can help support the organisations that support us by checking out their websites and products below.**

**Online Tournament Passes:**

ACL live events have long been 'pay at the door' type events. While we don't want to stop this service and the convenience of cash, we are trying to limit the administrative duties involved with this process. For starters, teams can sometimes show up last minute or don't confirm their registration. Not knowing confirmed teams can cause problems for table, venue and layout planning. Secondly, the registration process on the day can be vastly streamlined by the prepay process. Thirdly, and more obviously for event organisers, it lessens some of the burden of event costs prior to the date. So at the end of the day the event pricing hasn't changed at all, if you're organised. Pay online early and help us spend more time creating an awesome event for you!
