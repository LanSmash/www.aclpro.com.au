, shares his views on the Aus Gaming House:





"
It was a bit of a surprise but a welcome one when I heard the ACL team were opening their own gaming house. It's something we have never really seen here in Australia but it makes for a great place for teams to get together for pre-LAN training and even accommodation where possible. My team was lucky enough to secure a place at the Aus Gaming House and they are very keen and excited to check the place out and get in some prep for ACL Sydney! It's a great move by the ACL team and shows just how far they have come and how dedicated they are to providing premier gaming services to Australian gamers."
