ACL is pleased to announce a draft plan of its 2012 season schedule for National events. These are the 'big ones' that every gamer will be excited for, with the biggest attendance and cash prizes!








Season Insight




Don't forget ACL will still be running Regional events in capital cities another 3 times this year, earning much needed season points to seed your team for the National events.





So to re-iterate a few things that represent changes in 2012:





- There are now 3 components to earn season points. These are named below





- 
**ACL Nationals.**
 A National level live event with the biggest cash prizes and attendance. These occur 3-4 times a year. Typically 200-300 gamers vie for the most season points on offer - 
100% of points.

- 
**ACL Regionals.**
 A regional level live event held in capital cities around Australia (including Perth & Adelaide). These events are SPLIT per title and usually field 30-40 gamers per event. We will have regionals for Halo, Mw3, SC2 and I am pleased to guarantee regionals for Fifa12. These events garner more season points than online events - 
60% of points.

- 
**ACL Online Rounds.**
 An online event open to everyone in Australia & NZ. These are fiercely competitive and field between 100-200 gamers, but points distribution is lowest due to the unequal playing field presented by the online medium - 
40% of points.




- 'ACL Nationals' is the new name for our biggest national scale events. These will no longer be called by the previous system (eg. Sydney LAN) as this could cause confusion with Regional events.





- An 
**ACL NATIONAL FINALS**
 event will be held this year on top of 3 preceding events. Details on this are yet to be confirmed, but ACL is aiming to make this event bigger and better than any National event ever before. 





- Points will mean even more this year and getting into the top 8 teams prior to the ACL National Finals will ensure something extra special.
