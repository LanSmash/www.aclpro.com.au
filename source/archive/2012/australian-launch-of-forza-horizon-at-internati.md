A new Ferrari is always cause for celebration, and you can still hear the cheers from fans of the 458. Little wonder: the Prancing Pony went above and beyond the call with this gorgeous example of road-devouring art. The 458 produces 562 horsepower and a top speed over 200 mph, giving it the kind of performance you normally only see on the world’s greatest race tracks.

Available only in Europe, this could be the sportiest Golf to date. Two hundred and sixty seven horsepower from its 2.0-liter turbo make it a kick in the pants when pushed, and it can be pushed all the way up to a governor-mandated 155 mph. Twin central exhaust tips, L shaped LED taillights, and plenty of glossy black give the Golf R a look that matches its performance.
