**Mindfreak Esports and ACL Community present a Halo Reach 'No Pro' Tournament**





**Fresh off the launch of ACL Community we are pleased to announce the first ACL Community tournament of 2012! Hopey from Mindfreak Esports in conjunction with ACL Staff will run this tournament leading up to ACL Gold Coast to provide perfect practice for newer or less experienced teams to gain more valuable tournament practice to sharpen their skills for our first Nationals event of 2012.**





**Details**

How does this tournament differ from a regular ACL Reach 4v4 tournament? Well 'Pro' teams are not allowed to compete in this tournament in order  to open up the playing field for much more even competition and give a chance for some newer and less experienced players to shine. Now Pro teams don't take offence to this rule, it simply means your skill is widely recognised in this community, and you are too good to compete

Unfortunately these teams and their players are unable to compete in this tournament:


-Immunity


-Mindfreak


-Lateral


-Vox Eminor


-Break Even






**Prizes**

Thanks to Mindfreak Esports each member of the winning team of this tournament will win a 3 month xbox live membership.






*Must have a minimum of 10-15 teams registered in this tournament for teams to be eligible for prizes.





**When**

9th of January - 14th of January






**Pool Play**
 - 9th of January - 13th of January



**Double Elimination**
 - 14th of January






**TIMES**

9th Jaunary - 13th January - Whatever times you schedule with teams in your pool.


14th January - Double Elimination tournament starts at 12pm AEDT






**Structure**


**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Pool Play will be run from Monday January the 9th of January to Friday the 13th of January it is up to teams to organise with other teams in their pool when they will play each other. All Pool Play matches must be competed by Friday night.


Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.


Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.


There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.






**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.
