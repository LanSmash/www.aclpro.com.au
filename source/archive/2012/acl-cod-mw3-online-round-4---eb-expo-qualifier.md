**Structure:**



**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have between 4-6 teams. This is dependent on registration numbers and could change.


Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.





Pool play gametypes will look like this - CTF, S&D, CTF.





There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage. Teams will go head to head on Saturday in Pool Play to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on Sunday. 






**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16. If you do not show up to your Placement Rounds you forfeit your chance of earning the best possible result for your team. Double elimination will occur Sunday and be played out all day until a winner is found. 





Double elimination map rotation - CTF, S&D, CTF, S&D, CTF.
