**ACL Gold Coast League 1 - National Starcraft II Event**








ACL Gold Coast is just around the corner. All of the qualifying rounds and competitions have been played and the final standings are in. For those new to the format, we have seen Regional live events right around Australia and an online competition to finalise these seedings for the Gold Coast. This will mark the culmination of the first 'League' and there will be 3 more Leagues before the end of the 2012 Pro Circuit. Moving forward there will be a change to the structure for Online competitions. There will be 3 x Online comps in each League, with less weighting. This will make attending events and earning points even easier for those busy gamers among us. All of these structure elements are detailed 
[on this Rules & Structure page.](http://www.aclpro.com.au/procircuit/sc2-structure-2012)

We endeavour to provide the most competitive, entertaining, spectator friendly events of any ground-up community organisation.**
