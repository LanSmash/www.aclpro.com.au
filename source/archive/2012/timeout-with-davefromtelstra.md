**Timeout With DaveFromTelstra**





**Recently Beware from ACL sat down with DaveFromTesltra from Gears of War 3 team Legacy. DaveFromTesltra and his team Legacy took out ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 and are looking to do the same coming into ACL Sydney. Today we get his thoughts from ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1, information about the growing and dominate Gears scene in Australia and whats coming up ahead for Legacy.**





**ACL: Thanks for sitting down with me Dave, can you start off by telling us a bit of information about yourself?**





**Name:** Jay Lloyd



**Gamertag:**DaveFromTelstra



**State:** NSW on the Central Coast



**Current Team:**Legacy



**Favourite Gametype & Map:**  KOTH Rustlung



**Hobbies:**My only real hobby would have to be gaming



**Other Favourite Games:** The only game I really play at all is Gears of War 3






**ACL: Tell us a bit about your gaming background and how long you have been playing the Gears series?**





**Dave:** Well like most people I initially bought a xbox to play Halo 3 casually. Then like everyone else I moved on to CoD. Around when MW2 was all hacks etc I started playing Gears which would of been early 2010 but I only just started playing Gears competitively of recent on Gears 3 before that I had only played scrims.






**ACL: Can you tell us some of past achievement and tournament/competition wins in the Gears series?**

 



**Dave:** None by myself personally but my team held first spot on Gears 2 from beginning to end and they also won the only Cybergamer tournament held for it.






**ACL: Some people who are reading this interview won’t know a great deal about the Gears community. Can you give us a bit of background about the Gears community? How big you guys are? How long you guys have been active?**





**Dave:** The Gears communty isn't anywhere near as big as CoD but the commitment and dedication shown throughout it is what makes Gears excel in Australia. Everyone knows everyone whether it be the public side or competitive. Gears 3 is only begining to grow again in Australia as majority of it's players left with the mistake of Gears 2, but with Gears 3 the dedication whether it be old or newplayers we all strat/scrim/practice as heavily as any other successful e-sports title. My team will personally practice/scrim etc every couple of days now just to stay on top of our game.






**ACL: On to ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1. Can you give the readers your overall opinion of the tournament and how it went?**





**Dave:** The tournament was great it was a major success in my opinion, even it was only to show that Gears 3 can be a successful game on the ACL circuit in Australia. It was also the first tournament Gears 3 has had in Australia, so it gave everyone a taste of what it's like whether they chose to play or spectate.






**ACL: Now on to your own team, Legacy, and how your team performed throughout the tournament. Many were predicting you guys to win the tournament and it seemed a mere question of who had the biggest chance of beating you guys. During the tournament however Legacy got knocked down to the Losers Bracket by Team Obscure, the result of this shocked pretty much everyone. Can you tell the readers what attributed to this? And what was going through your teams mind during that series?**





**Dave:** During that series we had a few internet problems resulting in a player lagging out in our KOTH game. We also had technical problems on another players end where certain buttons weren't working on their controller but overall we just underestestimated them. We weren't discouraged even after our loss as we felt like we could play much better. So throughout the rest of the tournament we played at 100% and won 18 maps straight to win the whole tournament from there.









**Legacy displayed an incredible run through the losers bracket to win ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 where they took down many strong teams, including Malice.**





**ACL: Is it true that your series loss against Obscure was only your second series loss since Gears of War 3 was released? How has Legacy managed to stay so dominant in Gears of War 3?**





**Dave:** I think it's definitely been the skill gap as we've only really started strating etc now 5 months after release but now you'll see teams coming closer or even beating us these days because they're finding more adaptive ways to play the game. Every strat on this game has its counter strat its just been an execution thing in the past where as now teams are reaching a higher skill cap, which is making these things easier to acheive.






**ACL: Coming into the Grand Final of ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 you were facing Teknicity who made their run all the way through the Winners Bracket, meaning you had to beat them twice (6 wins). How was your team feeling coming into the Grand Finals? Were you confident you could take it out? Or worried that Teknicity had the advantage (only having to win one best of 5 series)?**





**Dave:** We were very confident coming in to the Grand Final. We're probably Teknicity's bogey team in my opinion as we've never dropped a map to them on the Gears 3 ladders before and have very good understanding of how Teknicity play out their matches as we've versed them many times on Gears 2. Not to mention we were on a massive win steak already so confidence wasn't an issue.






**ACL: Were there any results that surprised you in ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1? Any teams you expected to do better or any ‘upsets’ you didn’t expect?**





**Dave:** Yes a few besides us losing against Obscure. I expected BBR to go staight to the finals and I also expected Dark Sided to beat Innate Behaviour as Dark Sided have been a top team since Gears 1 and definitely deserved a better placing then top ten. I also expected Euphoric Gaming Network to make it past Pool Play as they're easily a top 10 team in my opinion but it's just how these things play out and it's also half the fun.






**ACL: What did you think of the coverage of the event? Vero Prodigy, Strangulate, Gandhi, Fallout and even our very own ACL Gears Admin Midnite all taking turns commentating and streaming games.**





**Dave:** I thought it was great and overall I'd give majority of the praise to Midnite as he was the one who orgainised all these things. As a player having to organise and keep order of the entire tournament by yourself in between games can take it's toll on him and his team. I'd also like to thank him again on the fact that the $400 prize money came directly out of his pocket,  I think it also shows his dedication to Gears of War 3 and how much he's willing to do to help competitive Gears 3 succeed in Australia.









**ACL Gears of War 3 Online Round 1 hosted an amazing talent of casters for spectators and players alike to enjoy. Check out this game with Commentary from ex-Halo professional player and MLG Halo commentator Gandhi and MLG Gears coach Vero Prodigy.**





**ACL: Looking forward to future tournament, your team Legacy has recently made an announcement that you are looking for a new player. What has caused this team change decision? And how is the recruitment process going?** 






**Dave:** Well we were only really looking for an experienced and well-rounded sub. We sometimes struggle to get enough players on to scrim meaning we weren't getting enough practice in but in the last couple of days we've picked up Aesthetic Mango. So now when 3 of our core members are online we have another player that can fill the void left by the missing player.






**ACL: ACL Sydney is less then 2 months away now and of course we will be hosting Gears of War 3 for the first time ever at an ACL Event. How are Legacy feeling going into the event? Also I’ve been told this is the first major Australian LAN event for the Gears series since 2007, will this be your teams first LAN event?**





**Dave:** Yes this will be our teams first LAN event. Overall we are just very excited to attend LAN regarless whether we win or lose. This will be the first time we've met all these players we've known for years and we think it will be an overall amazing experience one of which I think you'd be crazy to miss out on. Of course we will still be entering with the desire to win and with enough preparation we believe this can be achieved.






**ACL: Based on the teams registered for ACL Sydney and the teams you know will be attending how do you think the results will end up? Do you think your team can take it out? And what teams do you expect to contest you guys for the top spot?**





**Dave:** I think it will be another success. I'd say around now we're looking at 14+ plus teams entering. I think aslong as we enter with the right mental attitudes we can take this event out. Between all the top teams I'd say the major contenders would have to be Legacy, Team BBR, Teknicity, Malice and Dark Sided. I couldn't tell you which teams will be playing off in the Final, but I can say that we'll be one of them.









**Expect a lot more of this at ACL Sydney, only hosting a lot more Gears action!**





**ACL: With all the hype around ACL Sydney there has even been some talk about European teams coming over to compete. The European CoD team Apex has strongly hinted they may be making an appearance and perhaps a Gears team will be coming with them. If a European Gears team does come over do you think Legacy or any other attending Australian team will have what it takes to contest them?**





**Dave:** I think that if we're on our game then we definitely have a massive chance of taking them out especially if we play like we did in the ACL Online Round 1. The major factor would be LAN experience as we've never played LAN we don't know what to expect and if anything that will be our downfall.






**ACL: Lastly, looking at the international Gears of War 3 scene, MLG recently made the announcement that Gears will not be featured for their Winter Season. What do you think of this decision? With all the enthusiasm being displayed internationally for Gears and Hypefestation in America do you think it was a bad idea for MLG to not capitalise on this? Is Gears more popular worldwide then most think?**





**Dave:** Gears 3 is definitely more popular worldwide than what most people think. It's bigger than many games that are taken more serious. I think MLG have made the wrong decision for the time being but I don't see it being all done and dusted for Gears 3 and MLG. It will continue to grow worldwide through other events and all the players dedication and loyalty to the game they love.






**ACL: Thanks for taking the time to chat with us today Dave. Before you go however, do you have any shoutouts?**





**Dave:** Shoutout to Aesthetic Mango and my cold dinner.






**ACL: Thanks again Dave and good luck to yourself and Legacy in 2012!**
