**Structure**


**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.


Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.





Pool play will be played following Decerto's current ruleset meaning the three gametypes will look like this - CTF, S&D, CTF.





There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.






**Pro Pool Play**
 - Top 6 ranked teams based off 2011 season points.



**Open Pool Play**
 - Everyone outside the top 6 teams.





Pool Play will consist of several Open Pools and one Pro Pool (based off of last years results). Teams will go head to head on Friday the 6
th of January and finishing Saturday the 7
th of January in a Round Robin tournament to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on both Saturday the 7
th and Sunday the 8
th of January.









**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.





Double elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all tie breakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed into the top 16 double elimination bracket to fight it out to win the prize money. Double elimination gameplay will commence straight after the last pool play matches have been played on Saturday the 7
th of January and run until Sunday the 8
th of January.





Double elimination map rotation - CTF, DOM, CTF, S&D, CTF.
