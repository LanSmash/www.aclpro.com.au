**Blizzard World Championship Series Australia Nationals & Oceania Finals - Ticket Details!**





**Due to the high demand for the Blizzard WCS event and the extremely fast ticket sell out time we have made extra arrangements to try and accommodate those who missed out. Below outlines further ticket plans and information that both current ticket holders and people seeking tickets should be aware of.**



**Ticket Confirmation:**

On Wednesday 1st August all current ticket holders will receive a confirmation email that asks them to let event organisers know of their intent to still attend the event.  If ticket holders reply letting ACL know that they will no longer be attending the event then the tickets will become available again to the public. These tickets will then be re-released separately to 'giveaway tickets' and released in the exact same method as the original tickets using the 'first in, best dressed' method.






**Giveaway Tickets:**

ACL will hold a series of ticket giveaways this coming week from our Twitter and Facebook pages. These tickets will be given away in a number of different ways (trivia, random, first reply etc) so keep an eye out as they will go quick! It is unconfirmed how many 'giveaway' tickets we are allowed to offer at this point, but understand the number is very limited. If you are already a current ticket holder you are unable to win further tickets.






**Blizzard WCS Barcraft - Hosted in conjunction with APL:**

ACL and APL have organised a Barcraft event at the Paragon Hotel on Saturday August 11th to house the many fans of this great game and culture. Kudos to the APL guys getting involved and helping to keep this huge event accessible to all those who want to watch this even. ACL will be doing what it can to make sure this is a barcraft you don't want to miss !
