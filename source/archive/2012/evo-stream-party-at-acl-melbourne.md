CouchWarriors will be taking a bit of a different approach to tournaments for the weekend. As everyone will be glued on the action throughout the day on the big screen we'll be running alternative rules to normal tournaments. We're toying with the idea of less "serious" and more fun tournaments such as teams, random, low tier and many others, but we'd love your suggestions. Got a format you think would be fun? Please suggest it over at their 
**[facebook event page](http://www.facebook.com/events/120378371435067/)**. The current plan is to run Armies on Sunday for each game. This involves splitting all the competitors into two teams and having them play off against each other while their team cheers them on until only one is left standing.

 will also be on site selling their gear and have even provided an awesome Qanba QRAF4 to give away, you could win it just by attending the event!
