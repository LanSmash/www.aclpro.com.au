**ACL FIFA 12 Online Round 4 - EB Expo Qualifier!**





**The final ACL FIFA 12 Online Round of the 2012 ACL Pro Circuit is officially announced! Unlike typical ACL Online Rounds, this tournament will also play host to a FIFA qualifier for the EB Expo tournament to be later this year in October, live from Sydney! Placings mean everything in this tournament as you can earn a spot to the FIFA tournament at EB Expo through this Qualifier, so make sure you get practicing!**




The FIFA finals event held at EB Expo's Home Grown Gaming Arena is largely an invite only tournament, however there will be spots available through Open Play over the weekend. This Online Qualifier is open to all players, giving everyone a fair and even opportunity to be showcased to Australia live at the EB Expo. This online qualifier will also seed the top 12 spots in a straight up double elimination bracket at EB Expo, meaning the better you do in this tournament the better chance you have at the Finals event.






**Available Spots:**

There are 
**12** individual spots available to be earned through this Online Qualifier. The top 12 placing entrants will earn a spot to compete at EB Expo and show off their skills in front of thousands of spectators and gamers. Please note that this Online Qualifier is 
**NOT**
 the only way to gain entry to the EB Expo Finals, however it does offer the most spots as only 
**4** spots will be available during Free Play at EB Expo.

All other players must fight their way through Open Pool Play. From their, dependant on the number of participants and the sizes of the pools, 1 or 2 of the players with the best results from their pools will progress to the Open Double Elimination Bracket. This Open Double Elimination Bracket will determine the Top 8 players to progress to the Invite Double Elimination Bracket. In Invite Double Elimination, the players that progress through the Open Brackets will match up with the players from Invite Pool Play in the Invite Double Elimination Bracket consisting of 12 players, seeds 1st-4th being the Invite Pool Play players and seeds 5th-12th being the Open Bracket players who progressed to this stage.
