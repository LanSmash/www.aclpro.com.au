**Online Tournament Passes:**

ACL competitions have long been 'pay at the door' type events. While we don't want to stop this service and the convenience of cash, we are trying to limit the administrative duties involved with this process. To help with ease of service and ease of organisation we are again providing Online Tournament Passes for competitors to pay before the date at a discounted rate. Paying at the door is $5 more expensive then paying online so why not save some money today! You can buy Online Tournament Passes for all titles at ACL Melbourne 
**[here](http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/store/category/4-tournament-passes-prepay-prices-/)**. Paying early online through our store system secures your spot in the tournament and allows you or your team cheaper entry to the event. Go buy your Online Tournament Pass now
