**The second Halo: Reach 4v4 online event of the 2012 circuit has been announced for mid March!**




The second Online Round of the 2012 Halo:Reach circuit is officially announced! This is your third chance to secure season points for the best possible ranking at the national championships later this year.  With MindFreak being our Gold Coast winners, who has what it takes to dethrone them as the number  1 seed? Dont miss your chance to take on the best in the second Online Round of 2012.






**What**

The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure ranking points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual score.

**Structure**


**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.


Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.


There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.






**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.
