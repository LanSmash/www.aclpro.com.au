**Forza Launch Event – “May The Forza Be With You”**





**In the midst of the latest and greatest cars from around the world at the 2012 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, were eight racing car seats in front of eight Xbox 360's and eight television screens, ready to show off the highly anticipated racing game from Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games, Forza Horizon.**

On the line were not pink slips to a "fully sick" car or a set of new tools or anything else that would enthuse your average rev head. Instead, something more aimed towards a gamers heart - a brand new Xbox 360. A group of 16 gamers from around the nation all eagerly waiting for the chance to t ake home the bundle, all you had to do was be in the top 3 to qualify in the preliminary round and then take out the second race on top. Easy right?





The first race got underway and it was chaotic. Cars were grinding against each other, and sharing pixel paint becoming all scratched up, bumpers and other random car parts went flying and someone even managed to flip their Lamborghini. However, the top few had managed to break away from the shenanigans and there was no stopping them.

When race two came along it was my time to shine in the second and final preliminary round. Having played Forza Horizon at the EB Expo some weeks earlier in addition to a few practice rounds before the event started, consecutively finishing in the top two I felt quietly confident. I knew how the car handled, I knew the danger spots in the track, I even knew some of my competition and their driving styles. But when that green light flashed, my confidence quickly turned to caution as I tried to steer clear of anyone else and make my way to the front with my exotic Italian unscathed.





The plan worked. I had quickly made my way to front of the pack early on, and all I had to do was keep it that way. The first of the difficult corners approached. I knew when and where to brake and how to control the car into a nice drift around the corner. Everything was going well. Too well. I was half way around the corner, nailing it almost perfectly, and then BANG! I had turned from an elite racer into the braking assistance system for another driver. It was over as one after another my seven opponents passed me, presumably flipping the bird in their rear view mirrors. I was in last place. My dreams of a shiny new Xbox had quickly come to an end and as much as I tried to claw my way back to the top, I had lost all concentration and forgot everything about the tricky track, the feel of the car and was instead just trying to be as fast as possible to play catch up. I ended up crawling my way to fifth position but couldn't get anywhere near the leaders.

Then it was all down to this, the finals! The top drivers from the two previous races were going head to head, this time it was on. There was a bit of rivalry between those who knew each other, and once again the paint went flying. But this forced these drivers to the back of the pack, a lesson learned the hard way. Professional race car driver and lovely Sarah Harley commentated the races, giving her tips and critiques to the drivers along the way. The race was over in just over four minutes, and the winner Rory, was accompanied by the stunning Forza Horizon "booth babes" and was awarded his winners trophy from Sarah and went home with a brand new Xbox 360. This is how games should be promoted.





Now let's talk about the game itself. It's a risky maneuver from the team at long-term Forza developers Turn 10 and new guys Playground Games, bringing the tight racing mechanics we've learnt to expect from the Forza series, however adding an open world element often seen in the Need For Speed franchise. It seems to even take a similarly bright and bold coloured menu system from Dirt 2. 





As you'd expect the driving mechanics are once again phenomenal, you can even notice minor differences in the cars performance and handling whether it is tuned correctly or not. Another change from the regular tarmac based tracks seen in the previous Forza games, Forza Horizon offers wide variety of roads and includes races that combine normal tarmac as well as slippery dirt roads, and this can take a while to get used to. It's instantly noticeable from driving on the grip of tarmac to the slip and slide conditions of a dirt road where you need to learn to feather the accelerator to keep your ideal driving line in check. You’ll also find that it will take some time to adjust and get the transition between the two perfectly. Also, let it be known that there is a reason that we don't see people driving Lamborghinis on dirt roads. It's near impossible to stay straight and it’s terrible for the paintwork.





Single player has some sort of story involved all about getting to the top of the Horizon Festival, and for a racing game, the characters and voice acting actually seem half decent and also has you racing in a variety of different challenges, including against a hot air balloon. The game feels as though it's aimed at the more casual racer at times, allowing users to automatically tune cars just to fit the requirements and offers a huge variety of visual adjustments. However, it still keeps the same in-depth tuning flexibility that will keep Forza enthusiasts and car fanatics happy. 





 Visually, Forza Horizon is simply stunning, the high attention to detail of all the cars to the gorgeous landscape of Colorado. As always they have nailed the look of each and every car in the lineup paying homage to the skilled people that design these four wheeled monsters. It even has a wonderful "Google Satellite" like map to navigate your way around the in-game world. 





Another nice addition is the environment, being an open world game you have a chance to explore as much as you wish and the Turn 10 and Playground Games teams have chosen a fantastic location in Colorado. Providing a wide variety of different roads and environments from tight inner city streets, to driving around the Rocky's with nothing holding you back other than a small barricade between you and the edge of a cliff. Being an open world, another feature that the team is proud of is the weather and daylight/night engine. You will find yourself just wanting to free roam around the world to see some of the scenes that occur throughout this Colorado environment.

Sound has a major influence in bringing this game to life. All the cars sound very different, unique and are extremely authentic, but this time Forza has included some commercial music into the game, which to me, plays a big role in the enjoyment of a racing game and is a welcome change from the repetitive and boring beats heard in Forza 4. There are three different radio stations Horizon Bass, Horizon Pulse and Horizon Rocks with songs from Avicii, Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys and hopefully this will suit everyone’s music tastes. 





One thing I didn't enjoy was the constant amount of advertising in-game that is constantly shoved in your face. While I can understand that it's meant to be a festival event, and a festival has sponsors, it often feels like I'm playing through an interactive commercial. However, since playing Forza Horizon I have had strange cravings for a Rockstar Energy Drink.





While we were only playing Forza Horizon for a small period of time, the amount of achievements we received was crazy. Depending your view of achievements, this can be a good or bad thing. Although, I did enjoy some of the titles/pop culture references of these achievements such as "#WINNING!",  "A Wristed Development" and my personal favourite "May the Forza Be With You".

Overall, Forza Horizon is an absolutely beautiful game, having moved away from the traditional Forza format and adding elements seen in other racers while including some of their own new flair to the genre, and trying to find a place between a in-depth driving simulation experience and a casual racer. Will the risk of changing the format have pay off? Only time will tell. 





Forza Horizon is out in stores October 23rd 2012.
