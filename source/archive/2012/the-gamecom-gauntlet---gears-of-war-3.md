**The GAMECOM GAUNTLET - Gears of War 3**


**GAMECOM has had a hugely successful launch week to their new community portal here down under. To keep things cranking along, they are proud to announce something very special, their first online competition being run on the GAMECOM website. The rise and rise of the Gears of War 3 community is something GAMECOM is choosing not to ignore but rather celebrate, so its fitting for the hit console title to be supported by them for their next online event.**



**A prize announcement will follow in the next few days, but rest assured this will be a competition you don't want to miss. To sweeten the deal GAMECOM has joined forces with one of its partners in ACL to help award season points for their 2012 Pro Circuit. This means that by competing in the GAMECOM GAUNTLET you will be earning valuable seeding points for their Sydney LAN event in April.





GAMECOM have asked the most respected game administrators; Midnite and his support staff to run the tournament, with the rules he used for earlier ACL Online rounds in effect. This great team of staff, and no doubt upcoming announcements for a live stream and commentary should make for a thrilling weekend of Gears 3 entertainment and gruelling competition.





Due to exceptionally high demand on their new website, GAMECOM have asked community partners to help launch their new competition while they transfer hosting. This means that all you need to do to register is to send an email to 
registrations@gamecom.com.au following the set format described below.**

**Structure**





**Pool Play – Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have (tba – usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.


Each series MUST plan ALL 3 games.


There is only one rotation of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine the next stage.





Teams will go head to head on Friday the 30th and finishing on Saturday the 31st of March in a Round Robin tournament to ultimately determine their seed for the Double Elimination bracket finals to be held on both Saturday the 31st and Sunday the 1st of April.






**Double Elimination – Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs earlier.  Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement rounds will determine the Overall Points for your placing.





Double Elimination will occur after pool play has completed and after all the tiebreakers have been played. The top few teams from each pool will be placed in the DE bracket to fight it out to for the top spot and the prizes that go alongside it.


Double Elimination gameplay will commence straight after the last pool play matches have been 


played on Saturday the 30th and will run through to Sunday the 31st of March.


Registration & Confirmation


To register, send an email to 
registrations@gamecom.com.au . Once registered, you will be placed into a Pool. A week prior to the event a confirmation thread will be posted. Once posted, all teams need to confirm their attendance. This is to ensure Midnite and his staff can make things run as smoothly as possible.
