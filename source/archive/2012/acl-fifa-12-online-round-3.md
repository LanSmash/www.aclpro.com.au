The times mentioned above means you are 
**READY TO PLAY**
 at those times. For every 15 minutes you are late, you forfeit a game. Times may vary slightly as a 3 game series can take up to an hour. The only exception to the 15 minute rule is if a series is still going that was started on time.





This competition is for overall points in the season, exactly like Halo and CoD. If you're topping the ladder at the end of the season you will be regarded as the best FIFA player in Australia!





Every fixture will be organised in a strict schedule, if you are not online to play the game, you will unfortunately forfeit.
