**How it Works**

Paying early online through our store system secures your spot in the tournament and allows you or your team cheaper entry to the event.






Example: Starcraft 2




$20 Pre-pay online for OPEN BRACKET Entry


$25 At the door for OPEN BRACKET Entry 


- Top 8 from OPEN BRACKET pay additional $20 to compete in PRO BRACKET (total $40-$45)





$40 Pre-pay online for PRO BRACKET Entry


$45 At the door for PRO BRACKET Entry






Example: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3




$45 Pre-pay online


$50 At the door






Example: FIFA 12




$10 Pre-pay online for OPEN BRACKET Entry


$15 at the door


 - Top 8 from OPEN BRACKET pay additional $25






**All tournament passes are $5 cheaper paying early online than paying at the door at ACL Sydney on the day!**






**Why the change?**

ACL competitions have long been 'pay at the door' type events. While we don't want to stop this service and the convenience of cash, we are trying to limit the administrative duties involved with this process. For starters, teams can sometimes show up last minute or don't confirm their registration. Not knowing confirmed teams can cause problems for table, venue and layout planning. Secondly, the registration process on the day can be vastly streamlined by the prepay process. Thirdly, and more obviously for event organisers, it lessens some of the burden of event costs prior to the date.





So at the end of the day the event pricing hasn't changed at all, if you're organised. Pay online early and help us spend more time creating an awesome event for you!
