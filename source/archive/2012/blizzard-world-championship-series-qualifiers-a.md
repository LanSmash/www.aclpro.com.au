**ACL Regionals 3 - Blizzard World Championship Series Qualifiers!**





**The Australian Cyber League is proud to announce the details of our Starcraft 2 Regionals 3 dates. If you missed the announcement, you may be pleased to hear these events are also home to the Australian Blizzard World Series Qualifiers! If successful at one of these tournaments you will earn yourself a spot at National event held later in the year. Read below for all the details and how you can register yourself for one of these qualifiers!**


**Blizzard World Series Qualifiers being ran in conjunction with ACL Regionals:**

The Starcraft II World Championship Series consists of tournaments held in nearly every part of the world, bringing players from all over the globe together to compete for pride, glory and prizes.





Starting with National Qualifiers, players will battle it out for a chance to prove they have what it takes to be the best in the country, and qualify for the Oceanic Finals in their part of the world. Then, the winners of the Oceanic Finals will earn a place to fight in the Starcraft World Championship Series, where theyâ€™ll compete for not only prizes, but the title of World Champion.





The Australian Cyber League have been named the Primary Partner of the Australian stage of the Blizzard World Championship Series and as such our Regionals events and ACL Melbourne will be qualifiers for the Nationals event to be held later in the year. The Nationals event (details TBA) will host all the qualified players in a tournament with $6000 in prizes to be given away thanks to Blizzard. On top of that, the top 6 players from the Nationals will be invited to complete for $12000 in cash at the Oceania finals.






**ACL Season Structure:**

For those new or unfamiliar to the Australian Cyber League, there are 3 components to our competitions and season, each awarding points for your performance in these events.





- 
ACL Regionals: As announced, an open invite to compete for season points in each city.





- 
Online Events: An open invite for all to compete online against players in Australia & NZ.





- 
National Events: 4 of these in 2012. The next to be shortly announced as ACL Melbourne. These have the biggest attendance & biggest prizes.






**How the circuit will work in brief:**

You will earn points for every placing you receive within the top 32 at each event you compete in during 2012. Each component of the competition has a varying weighting of points distribution.





The National events for Starcraft 2 are Invite Only for the Pro Bracket. Invitations will be sent out based on your season points and only the top 16 ranked players in Australia by season points will be invited to the most advantageous spot for the Tournament. All other competitors at National events must fight their way through the Open Bracket.





Everyone in most capital cities will have 2 chances to accrue season points before the first national event. 1 x Live Qualifier (ACL Regionals event) and 1 x Online Round before each National event.
