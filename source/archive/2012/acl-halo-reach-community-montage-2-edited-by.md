**1 year later, just before the release of Halo 4, but here it is!**




Australian Cyber League and Vendetta Films proudly present the ACL Halo Reach Community Montage 2 edited by Backfire. This montage showcases some of the most amazing MLG clips the ACL community produced from the inception of Reach to late 2011.












**"This montage was never completely finished and all gameplay after 04:35 is unedited and very raw due to the fact the second half of the montage was still in progress. Due to laziness on my behalf and myself providing Backfire with no direction post October 2011 this montage has just sat unfinished for almost a year. I decided to release this unfinished version of the montage so everyone can see the amazing work Backfire did with our community's clips. Although it is a shame that the montage was unfinished and I apologise to Backfire for not pushing this project forward he still did an amazing job and I can't thank him enough for his work."**
