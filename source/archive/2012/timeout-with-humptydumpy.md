**Recently ninja brett from ACL sat down with Humptydumpy a pro FIFA player on ACL. Humpty came third in ACL FIFA Online Round 1 then improved on that placing coming in second in Online Round 2. He will be looking to improve once again on this impressive result come ACL Sydney. Today we get his thoughts from ACL FIFA Online Round 2 and the FIFA scene in Australia.**

**ACL: Tell us a bit about your gaming background and how long you have been playing FIFA?**





**Humpty:** I have been playing fifa since fifa 2003. I was very young and used to play a lot with my older brother, once i got xbox live when fifa08 came out. It became my passion and i was roughly ranked in the top 300 in the world. After FIFA 2008 i moved onto COD for a few years, but after FIWC 2010 i regained my love for FIFA and soon found out about other competitive tournaments. 






**ACL: Can you tell us some of past achievement and tournament/competition placings in FIFA?**

 



**Humpty:** Well my first tournament was FiWC 2010 in which i made the final 16 at the Australian live event. The following year at FiWC 2011 i made the final 32 in the Australian live event. 


Since FIWC i played in lots of ACL tournaments and made the top 3 in every ACL tournament ive played in, which includes ACL Sydney LAN 2011, ACL online round 3 2011, ACL online round 1 and 2 2012. My highest placement was runner up in ACL or3 2011 and ACL or2 2012. Also, i came third in FIFA 11 CyberGamer finals series last year.






**ACL: Now on to your own performance, and how you performed throughout the tournament, You lost in WBR2 and were then put into loser bracket how did that effect you?**





**Humpty:** It seems to be an ongoing trend in losing early in the winners bracket, but i think i always find a way to grind through the losers bracket. In 3/4 ACL tournaments i have competed in, i have fought my way into  the top 3 from the losers bracket. I guess it may be the added pressure that makes me step up my game. 


Also I like to think of a famous Muzza255 quote - "Champions are made in the losers bracket!"






**ACL: Coming into the Grand Final of ACL FIFA Online Round 2 you were facing Muzza who made it all the way through the Winners Bracket. How were you feeling coming into the Grand Final? Were you confident you could take it out? Or worried that Muzza had the advantage?**





**Humpty:** Well my goal for ACL Online round 2 was to make the grandfinal, and once I got there I felt lots of relief. Obviously having to play someone like Muzza isn't ideal, but my results against Muzza in fifa 12 are actually relatively good and in ACL Online round 1 when we met in LBF he only won by aggregate, so i felt it was possible. However, muzza was yet to not win a match and produced some ridiculous scorelines in the winners bracket, and was simply the better player in the final.






**ACL: Were there any results that surprised you in ACL FIFA Online Round 2? Any players that exceeded expectations or any ‘upsets’ you didn’t expect?**





**Humpty:** From what i can remember, there wasn't an awful lot of surprises but i think RVP did extremely well coming from open pool play to make the top 4. When I played him in losers bracket round 5, he won the first match 2-0 and was leading 1-0 in the second match at half time. I managed to turn it around and luck was a bit on my side but he played very well and is a top player. 


Also, DmAuViIrD defeating Skip1 in the winners bracket caused quite a stir.






**ACL: You attended your first LAN which was ACL Sydney last year were you placed an impressive 3rd, how are you feeling about ACL Sydney this year?**





**Humpty:** I thought ACL Sydney was an awesome tournament and that's when i realised the quality of ACL's top players. The final between Muzza and Skip1 was so tense and controversial, and the nerves I experienced at LAN were really insane. 


I will definately be attending ACL Sydney this year, and I think lots of people will turn up. The quality of matches should be just as good as last year and it will be an awesome experience.












**Expect a lot more of this at ACL Sydney.**








**ACL: Thanks for taking the time to chat with us today. Before you go however, do you have any shoutouts?**





**Humpty:** No worries, I should probably give a shoutout to itz todd because we always work together and share strategies, and also the ACL staff who do a tremendous job in running these tournaments. Thanks 






**ACL: Thanks again Humpty and good luck to yourself at ACL Sydney!**
