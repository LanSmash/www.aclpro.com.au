**Australian Cyber League releases initial details for their 2014 ACL Pro Cricuit!**





**The Australian Cyber League has always been committed to providing the biggest, most exciting and most professional gaming events in Australia. Since 2006, we've been on a never-ending learning curve, finding out the best way to bring you high quality National-scale live events. In 2014, we are more dedicated to this cause than ever, and we will outline the position of ACL for this year and what you can expect from us.





With that being said ACL is pleased to release initial details on its 2014 circuit, however each event of the year will have its own full announcement. 2014 will see some changes to the typical structure that some may have grown used to over the years, however you can still expect bigger and better events than ever!**





**ACL's Position in 2014:**


In 2014 ACL and its core staff will be working on a myriad of eSports projects, some that tie in with the 2014 ACL Pro Circuit and some that do not. Projects ACL will be involved in throughout this year are the Call of Duty Championship, Blizzard's WCS Oceania/SEA Qualifiers and League of Legends events. All these events provide you, Australia's eSports player base, the opportunity to compete in events for the games you know and love. While they may not be typical ACL events, they are events that ACL and their staff members are working on to help push eSports in this region. As one could imagine, with so many events already scheduled in 2014 that we are involved in, we have had to modify our structure to not only accommodate for these events and allow time between them, but also to dedicate our resources in a logical and even manner that doesn't effect our level of quality. We wish to ensure every ACL event has the full level of service and experience you've come to expect in the past. To be clear, ACL will be involved in the running of more eSports events in 2014 than ever before.






**The 2014 ACL Pro Circuit:**


ACL is proud to announce our first National-scale live event for 2014 over the weekend of July 19th - 20th at the 
**Australian Technology Park**
 in Sydney.

**Announced Titles:**

That's right, the venue of Blizzard's WCS Australia & Oceania Finals returns for the largest ACL event to date. We will be utilising three separate, though conjoining, rooms at the Australian Technology Park. So each game will have its own room, with its own crowd, with its own mainstage!

**Online Rounds in 2014:**


We have listened, read, and gathered your feedback from 2013 and are going to implement this community feedback towards our Online Rounds in 2014. Typically, ACL has specialised in live events and used our Online Rounds as a tool to seed competitors for our LANs. This year we want to concentrate more on providing competitors with a better Online tournament experience. Our first series of Online Rounds will have their own individual announcement in the following weeks, so keep your eyes peeled!






**2014 & Beyond:**


Since 2009 Australian Cyber League, whether combined with the efforts of publishers or solo, has brought you some of the largest and most prestigious live events our region has ever seen. This is our passion, this is what we love to do. We have been doing it for 5 years and we hope to be doing it for at least another 5 years to come. We hope you are as excited as we are for 2014 and all the gaming action it will present for competitors. So get ready, get hyped and keep a look out for further announcements regarding the information we have provided above for the 2014 ACL Pro Circuit!
