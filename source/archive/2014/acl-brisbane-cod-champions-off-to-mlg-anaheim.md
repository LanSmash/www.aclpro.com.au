**ACL Brisbane Call of Duty Champions off to MLG Anaheim!**





**Expanding on our recent announcement of the first ACL 2K Series for Call of Duty Ghosts, today ACL is proud to announce that the winning squad at ACL Brisbane will be offered a direct seed into the International League Playoffs at MLG Anaheim! That's right, avoid a massive open bracket and compete against the best teams from America and Europe for a $70,000 prize pool!**




This announcement comes as ACL and MLG continue to build on a close working relationship throughout the Call of Duty Championship campaign. Combining the Pro Points tournaments online with our LAN events, together we are working to provide more opportunities for our region, making it easier to compete with the world's best Call of Duty players. While the winner of ACL Brisbane must find their own way to MLG Anaheim, the direct seed into the International League Playoffs is a huge step for ANZ eSports, and one we're very proud to announce.
