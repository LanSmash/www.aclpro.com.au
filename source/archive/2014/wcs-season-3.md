Big changes hit WCS Season 3 for 2014




Season 3 will follow a different format to that of previous seasons. For the first time two tournaments, one offline and one online, will seed players into WCS. 



*ACL Online Round 3 in June will now transform into a WCS Online qualifier where 1st place will take a WCS seed.
*ACL Sydney LAN in July will now also offer the second WCS Season 3 seed to 1st place.
