**CoD: Black Ops 2**


8 teams invite only. 4 teams will be invited from Yearly points (Season 1, Season 2 and Season 3) and 4 teams will be invited from Season 3 points (Online Round 5 & Online Round 6). There is a possibility that an Open Bracket will exist. Details are outlined below.






**Open Bracket Possibilities:**

At the beginning of 2013, the Sydney event was announced as invite only. This event marks the culmination of the entire year’s competition and those teams who have accumulated season points through good placings and repeat attendance are invited to attend. ACL maintains that these teams and players who have earned their spot deserve to be recognised for their efforts throughout the year.





We have noticed an overwhelming demand for the existence of an open bracket system, particularly for Call of Duty but also some Starcraft gamers. We acknowledge these requests, and are willing to incorporate an open bracket for these games provided some conditions are met. 





As an organisation wanting to push the envelope for production values and entertainment, the idea behind our finals series is to create a top quality stream and live atmosphere for each of our Pro Circuit titles. Having an open bracket drains our resources and means this is not feasible with our current level of supporters and volunteers. Combined with the time pressures of setup and packdown, we are often understaffed for these kinds of setups. This was a critical factor for us at ACL Melbourne and resulted in severe burnout from our core team. The impact of these pressures means over-tired staff and less effective performance for production – something we wanted to alleviate for our finals.





In order for us to effectively run open brackets, I would ask the following of the community:


-	We have minimum 1 additional admin volunteer for the running of each tournament (CoD & SC2)


-	We have minimum 5 volunteers (each game) help setup the open bracket play area on Friday 18th October. This is approximately 5-6 hours work.


-	We have minimum 5 volunteers (each game) help packdown the open bracket play area on the evening of Sunday 20th October. This is approximately 3-4 hours work.





If we can meet these conditions we will open up open bracket play for Saturday 19th October for a limited number of players/teams, whereby some will advance to the Championship bracket. To ensure the provision of these measures, we would then require pre-payment.





If you feel you can contribute to the ACL team in any of the ways above, please send through an email to 
**info@aclpro.com.au**
. In a similar vein, we are also looking for help with production (video, streaming etc) and if this interests you please shoot through an email reflecting this.
