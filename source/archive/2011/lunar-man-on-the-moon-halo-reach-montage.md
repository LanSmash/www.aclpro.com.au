**Lunar :: Man Man on the Moon :: Halo Reach Montage**





**This montage features our very own Lunar showing off some of his leftover clips that went towards the on-going creation of his first Halo Reach M1. For the fact that his montage is made entirely of leftover clips this the gameplay is very impressive, showing off some sick snipes, nice no scopes and sweet multikills. The editing is pretty simple yet enjoyable and flows well, certainly enough to keep you entertained. Congratulations Lunar for having his montage featured on FBWalshyFTW's youtube channel and getting it featured on the bungie.net homepage. Hope you all enjoy!**











Radic said:So this took way too long to finish. I got into contact with Lunar when he said he wanted someone to edit his leftover leftovers, I was just looking to try editing some Reach. I'm not gonna sell this short or oversell it, the video is what it is. This may very well be my last video, I never really reached where I wanted to as an editor and lately have just been extremely uninspired, part of the reason making this short vid took me over a month. Just wanted to thank Lunar for being patient with me, hope you all enjoy the video.





Lunar said:Hey guys this is my first Halo reach montage ill be releasing featuring the spare clips i got from the first few weeks of reach (lol). I know the gameplay isnt very good because of that reason, but i think Radic did a great job of making the entire tage enjoyable, hope you guys like it :-D Also be aware that the trailer for Lunars Reach M1 will be out very soon, be looking out for it ;-)
