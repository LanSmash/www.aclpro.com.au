**ACL's montage editor Asikk puts his editing skills to use editing his own leftover tage from 4 clips he had left that weren't used in the production of his full montage. Asikk edited this for the occasion of 100 subscribers to his youtube channel and to create some hype for the release of his first full Halo Reach montage. His full montage will be released very shortly so be sure to check back for it.**
