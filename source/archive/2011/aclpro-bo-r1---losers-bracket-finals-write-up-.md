**Fitzy | Guardian | Cheese | Phantm**





The first time these two teams matched up was during the Top 16 Double Elimination Finals Round 2 on Sunday the 27th. The following is what went down:


CTF Havana-DRAW


DOM Firing Rang-Fray


SND Summit-Fray


CTF Hanoi-DRAW	


DOM Summit - Fray

With the ACL continuation rule coming into play when two teams meet up again during the Finals,Fraystarted with a strong 3-0 lead in the Loser Finals against Mind.Freak.






**Firing Range - CTF**


Spoiler

It started off with Fray going straight down to business with Fitzy on Mindfreaks flag in the first 30 seconds. Dazed almost stopped Fray from going in the lead as he picked up Fitzy right near Frays spawn but Cheese was there to clean him up and successfully captured the flag. It was another two minutes of tight gameplay before Fitzy took off again, this time, successfully running it the whole way by himself. At the  1 minute mark Fitzy did it again, shortly followed by Guardian who with incredible team worked picked up another flag and then another one by Fitzy again. These quick flag captures put Fray in a 5-0 lead at half time, with Cheese going huge with his kill count. 






**Second Half**

Second half came and Fray were looking good for the win.Mindfreakcame storming out and refused to give up capturing a flag in the first minute. The next couple of minutes was just dominant Mp5ks everywhere before Fray picked up the last flag of the map to make the second half 1-1, and the full time score 6-1 Frays way. 



Spoiler


**Hanoi - Domination**

It started off nicely for Mindfreak with them holding two flags, but Fray quickly adapted and took A flag. Mindfreak tried to pushed A but Cheese was just shutting them down, until the finally got him down and took back A flag. Fray retaliated and captured the flag back and Mindfreak tried desperately to take control of it again but were unable to get the cap due to Fitzy and phantms' precision nade. Things were looking down for Mindfreak as they tried to gain ground but unfortunately Fray was too strong and in the dieing seconds of the half Fray captured all 3 flags leaving the score at 156-121 Frays way. 



Spoiler


**Second Half**

Second half started off with a bang asMindfreakquickly capped C and had 3 of their players running to A to contest it straight after Fray had captured it for a few moments. They successfully shut Fray out of the area and took it. With some nice double kills by Cheese, Fray were able to take C off Mindfreaks hands. They then took A off Mindfreak and dominated the map. Shortly after Mindfreaklooked to get back in the game and were about to cap A back, BOOM! Fitzy with a double nade and then a nice dropshot to stop them. Although Fergiwas nearby and was able to pick him up and get the cap. Mindfreak were in need of two flags if they wanted to have any chance of winning this map, but Fray were just too strong and took out the map with the total score of 307-249



Spoiler


**Villa - SND**

With Fray only needing one more game to take it out, it was do or die for Mindfreak.


The first round Fray was on defence. They held it solid defensive line with not one member of Fray going down and it was looking like they were going to take this game out. The second round Fray attacked and pushed B, got the bomb down successfully with Cheese picking up a double kill to secure another round. Now down by 2-0, Mindfreak pushed B to get the bomb down as they cleaned up 3 Fray players with zeeeQ cleaning up Cheese for the final kill to secure the round. The next round saw Fray on attack again pushing B hard, it quickly turned into a 4v3 situation in favor of Fray, but with some nice teamwork by zeeeq and Dazed over at B they were able to bring it back to a 3v1 situation withphantm the last one alive. Phantm went large and took out 2Mindfreak members berfore Rapture cleaned him up. Each team traded rounds 1 for 1 and neither team could get a 2 round lead to take out the map. Until finally Mindfreak stepped up and took out the game 8-6.



Spoiler


**Summit - CTF**

After 5 wins to Fray, Mindfreakfinally got a score on the board. Mindfreak were on a high and were hoping to keep the momentum flowing. The first 2 minutes neither team did too much damage with both teams going defensive and trading kill for kill. Fray managed to get the game going and took out 3 Mindfreakplayers, they quickly tried to take advantage of the situation and went for a flag cap but were shut down.Mindfreak then went for a counter cap with Fergi getting a massive triple at Frays spawn and ran the flag the whole way home. Fray tried to tie the round and went for another cap but were shut down by a strong Mindfreakdefence. The half ended with a 1-0 lead to Mindfreak. 



Spoiler


**Second Half**

The second half didn't start much like the 1st with Mindfreak quickly caping a flag in the first minute. The next couple of minutes were slow with Fitzy just going large with his AK. Fray tried to go for another flag, but still, Mindfreak just too strong and returned the flag. Mindfreak then set up 3 solid defenders, but Cheese came in guns blazing like a mad man to take 2 of the defending players out with the help of his team mate taking out the 3rd and Fray were able to pull their first cap. Mindfreakregrouped then set up again, but Fray took them down again. With 15seconds left of the clock Fray took MindFreaks flag. With 5 seconds left on the clock Guardian was just meters away from the capture point to take the map into overtime but Dazed barges through their defences and in with a double kill! He saves the flag and takes the victory for Mindfreak!



Spoiler





**Villa - Domination**

Mindfreak now pulled 2 in a row and that slight feeling of "wouldn't this be great if we pulled this back?" starts to creep into their mind, and with that, Mindfreak came into the next game pumped up and ready to pull this back. Mindfreak looked in control from the start, holding two flags for most of the half, Fray came back into the game to hold 2 flags but Mindfreakquickly recaptured the flag straight. All players of Mindfreak were doing their part in this half and played well together. They ended this half 170-104



Spoiler





**Second Half**

Fray came out looking better this half, they took 2 flags straight up, but Mindfreak took over quickly and held both A and B for a while, then Fray came back and held 2 for a couple of minutes to take the lead but needed 3 flags to win. As Fray looked to take the last flag, Rapture cleaned them up and went for a counter attack to allow Mindfreak to capture B. Fray came out hard again taking over B but with a minute left Mindfreak got it back. Fray captured it back one last time and won the half 147 to 132 but it wasn't enough and Mindfreak took the win. 



Spoiler


**Hanoi - CTF**

3 maps straight, 3 to win. Mindfreak was just on fire right now. 1 minute in Mindfreak got the first cap. It was 2 minutes in before Fray touched their flag and almost ran it home before Fergi cut them off with only meters to go. At this stage, Mindfreak had 3 solid defenders, and it seemed to work, Fray managed to touch the flag once but got shut down very quickly. Leaving the half time score 1-0 Mindfreaks way.



Spoiler


**Second Half**

Second half started pretty slow with most of Mindfreak hanging around their flag. Fray managed to touch the flag, but like normal, were taken down almost straight away. Fray came hard again, this time they were able to run the flag out of danger. Just as Fray were about to cap the flag Rapture picks up the kill and Fergi jumps on the return. Fray were able to grab the flag 2 more times but were unsuccessful with both, ending the half at 0-0 and the full time score at 1-0 Mindfreaks way. 



Spoiler





**Havana - CTF**

Mindfreak had brought it back to 4-5, was it possible they could win? Havana took off nice and slow as it kicked into gear. With not much happening, both teams ended up going up each other side of the map. Fray were the first team to make a break with a flag, but as they were running backMindfreak picked up theirs, with a couple of kills it seemed sure Fray were about to cap, but zeeeQ denied them and went large picking up a double and returning Mindfreaks flag inches away from Frays flag. 



Spoiler





**Second Half**

Again it started off slow, Fray went for a take at 2 minutes in but were shut down by a solid Mindfreakdefence. Mindfreak went for a counter capture, but Fray said no thankyou and took their flag back instantly. With 2 minutes to go Dazed made a run for it with Frays' flag. With great cover from his team they picked up a flag and put themselves in the lead, Fray looked to counter cap but Fergi held strong and picked up the double, Fray tried again, desperately with only 1 minute left but it didn't work, then Fergi grabbed Frays flag and ran down fountain side, successfully capping it, with 20 seconds left it was all over and done for the map of Havana, and both teams now move into the Map decider with Mindfreak on the comeback train. 



Spoiler


**Havana SND**

Well this was it, possibly one of the biggest comebacks in the making, down 5-0 to pull it back 5-5 to take it to a map decider. Win or lose for Mindfreak they had played exceptional to do what they had just done. 


The first round started off with Mindfreak on the defence, Fergiquickly picked up a double following zeeeq picking up a kill then Rapture secured the round taking out Guardian after he cleaned up two of the Mindfreak members. The next round saw Mindfreak take a hard A that Fray could not handle and it showed for a quick round. The next round Fray pushed B, and managed to get the bomb down but unfortunately could not hold the defence down and Mindfreak got the defuse making it 3-0. 


It was do or die now for Fray on the Defence, and they managed to take the round with Cheese going large on a team down to take the final kill in a 1v1 situation. But they couldn't comeback from 3-1 down and Mindfreak came out hard and fast to secure the round. Winning the game 4-1.
