The winner of the official ACL MLG Raffle has been announced, and the lucky winner is Brad Bell (Gamertag: Bradlllzzz)!





Drawn in front of the entire crowd at ACL Sydney, ACL Director Nick Vanzetti drew Brad’s name from a bucket of 114 ping pong balls to declare him the winner.





Brad will travel to Anaheim, California with ACL admins Vanzo, Beware and Hoggy, along with the boys from Team Immunity.





Brad said he couldn’t believe his luck, and can’t wait to attend MLG Anaheim.





“I’m so shocked but extremely excited for the chance to go over there and watch an event,” he said.





“I used to live in San Francisco so it’ll be great to get back over there.”





MLG Anaheim is the first event that Team Immunity will attend since they placed a very respectable 17th at MLG Columbus last year.
