**This year the Australian Cyber League kicked off its 2012 Pro Circuit with a bang, introducing for the very first time ACL 'Regional' events to our Pro Circuit structure. ACL Regional events are LAN events held all around Australia for each individual flagship title for the purpose of creating more competition, building the local scene, awarding season points and giving players more chances to get invaluable LAN practice. With the introduction of Regionals how fitting it was for the first Regional events ACL held to be for Starcraft 2, the newest addition to our Pro Circuit line up. Starcraft 2 is one of the most entertaining and popular competitive titles in the world, and we have no doubt it will have a long and successful run on our Pro Circuit. Check out all the results from our first league of ACL Regionals below, and thank you to all competitors who came out and attended these events!**
