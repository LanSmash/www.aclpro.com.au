**ACL Melbourne may be gone but certainly not forgotten. To those that attended I am sure that they will agree in saying that it was one of the most impressive ACL events yet. Over the course of the weekend ACL Presenters Hooters and Inmaniac had a chance to sit down with a few teams and players over a variety of ACL titles and provide some interest questions and opinions for everyone to hear. Some of these interviews were broadcast live, but a lot weren't, so here again is some videos from ACL Melbourne for you all to enjoy.**
