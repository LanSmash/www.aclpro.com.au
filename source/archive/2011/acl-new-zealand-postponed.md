**ACL New Zealand Important Announcement**




On August 25th we announced ACL’s very first New Zealand Event for December 2011. 





This event has been the hot topic of the past week and we regret to inform you all that we are postponing this event.





It had come to our attention that the timing of this event wasn’t the best for the community and we decided it would be best to push it back.





We have worked hard to get this announcement out as soon as possible to avoid the community booking transport, accommodation and any other expenses associated with the event.





The whole team at ACL are deeply sorry for any inconvenience this has caused and we look forward to running an event in NZ in the future.
