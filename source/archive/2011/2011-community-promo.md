2011 is set to be a big year for ACL and all who want to be involved in our LANS. This thread is for the purpose of discussing the 2011 community promotional video, released this New Years Eve of 2011. This is not a promo vid for sponsors, but for gamers! To reflect on a great year in 2010, and to inspire more involvement in 2011. A shorter, punchier version will be made in the coming months.

I would like all of you to extend a big, big thank you to those involved with this video's production. Also, if you dislike the constant beat matching, blame me as it was my idea
