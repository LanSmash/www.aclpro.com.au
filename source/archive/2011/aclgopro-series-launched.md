**ACL officially announces the ACL'Go'Pro Series!**





**Today ACL launches the brand new Halo Reach media segment titled the ACL'Go'Pro Series. The ACL'Go'Pro series will be a series of gameplay films submitted by you, the ACL community, commentated on with evaluation from our most experienced, intelligent and skilled professional players here at ACL.**

To submit a film to potentially be chosen for evaluation by ACL professional players then you must follow these simple submissions instructions.


If you chose to submit your film through the ACL Forums then you must PM myself

You can only submit one film between every segment release and they must be MLG games only.
