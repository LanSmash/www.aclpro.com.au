Well, a 
hoodie is a jumper with a hood, to keep your head warm. We're looking at doing a range of hoodies with a variation of the ACLPro logo and some slick new design for 2011. This will be customisable, so you can have your very own gamertag on the back. Still no clue? This is what 2010's hoodie's looked like:

**2010 Hoodie Samples**







We're making a call for all designers out there to get creative and make a new design for us in 2011. I can have GFX fail (above banner supplied by me). Not only will you win $200, but you'll have your handywork on every supporting member's hot gaming bod for many cold years ahead. How cool would it be to see some dude you have never met wearing your design. Pretty mint.












**Design Requirements:**





Ok, so you have skills, but do you have skills with vectors? Don't know what they are? Google them. Basically, they're a type of line that can be resized without losing quality. The average photoshop design uses pixels. What happens when you resize pixels? Your pixels grow in size with your image, rather than creating many more new pixels. This means your image becomes (wait for it)....... PIXELATED and the quality goes to poo. If the printing company needs to print your image on a hoodie, they'll need the best possible quality image they can have. That's why it's best to design from scratch in Adobe Illustrator or Correl Draw or something like that using vectors. If you're unsure, contact a printing company and see what they usually require

**Competition Clauses:**





- I'm not going to hand over $200 to just any old design, so this competition may have NO winner if the folk at ACL aren't happy with what we're shown. 


- If the design is awesome, but not in the right format, then I still can't award you a winner. 


- The design will be judged by ACL staff, based on the opinions shown in the ACL forums.


- The deadline will be March 7th 2011









HAPPY DESIGNING !!
