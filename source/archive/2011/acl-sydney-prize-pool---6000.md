A whopping $6000 in cash and prizes is up for grabs at ACL's Sydney LAN event this July 2-3. This comes off the back of the continued support from our sponsor Razer, who will be providing $1600 worth of prizes for the event! A huge thanks must go to them for their support, and also providing 5.1 Wireless headsets for the main stage (read more about their Chimaera's
