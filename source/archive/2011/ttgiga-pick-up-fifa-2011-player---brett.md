Hey all,





I am excited to announce that we have recently recruited Brett “BreTt” Newton for our FIFA 2011 (console) section. Formerly known as ninjabrett, he has already achieved awesome results during the last couple of months, placing 2nd, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the three competitions run by the Australian Cyber League (ACL). Not only that, he has also secured his position for the Australian World Championship Gaming (WCG) national finals, after securing his ticket at the recent WCG Sydney qualifiers. 


Just recently, Brett also participated at the ACL Sydney LAN, where he was unfortunately knocked down from the finals.






**Up-coming competitions:**


- ACL finals at Brisbane in early October


- WCG national finals in mid-October, having secured his ticket at the WCG Sydney qualifiers.





Hopefully, BreTt can secure a spot for the WCG and represent Australia for FIFA 2011 while he is participating and achieving excellent results at LANs and tournaments. We are looking forward to BreTt’s achievements, not only for himself but for Tt.GIGA as an organisation.
