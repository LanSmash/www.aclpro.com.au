[**ACL Melbourne**](http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/topic/9179-acl-melbourne-announced/). ACL saw this as a great opportunity to allow the Black Ops players in the community to showcase some of their online scrims on 
[**ACL's Youtube Channel**](http://www.youtube.com/user/ACLProVideo?feature=mhum). Check out these 5 Black Ops gameplays, 4 from Team Fray, one of the best teams in Australia!**
