A little behind schedule yet just as excited as ever, Vanzo gave his introduction to ACL Sydney, one of the biggest events in ACL Pro’s history. Never have we seen such a great turnout, only comparable to the great AusHalo LAN ’09. With 18 confirmed Halo Reach teams showing, a 40+ attendance in the Reach FFA and nearly a 100% attendance rating from the rest of ACL’s titles, it truly is a massive event.





With Pool Play under way for Halo Reach, CoD Black Ops and FIFA, along with all of our MvC3, SS4, Smash Bros Brawl and Melee action, expect to see some surprising results soon. Who will shine and go strong into the Double Elimination Bracket, and who will take out the Reach FFA?
