QuoteV6 Halo: Reach Game Types are now out; these are the Game Types that will be used at MLG Orlando. Please read the settings carefully, as there have been some substantial changes. 





You'll notice that we have added two new maps to this v6. The first, Oasis, was designed and forged by MLG community member Waldo. The second map, Pit, was created by the prolific Salot, working with Broly_Bro. Pit is a remake of a Bungie Halo 3 map.




As our halo community will no doubt be aware: of this morning the MLG Halo Reach v6 settings have finally been released and much discussion has arisen as to which version of MLG gametypes will be used at ACL Brisbane. With a relatively short time between now and our National Championship LAN in October it is important that the right gametypes are chosen to make the tournament the most fun, balanced and competitive competition it can be. Due to the communities overall excitement about the release of these new gametypes and the increase of quality of gameplay and competition between version 5 and version 6 we have decided to give you guys what you want and play v6 at ACL Brisbane!
