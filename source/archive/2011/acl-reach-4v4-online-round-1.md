**The first Halo: Reach 4v4 online event of the 2012 circuit has been announced for mid December!**




The 2012 Halo Reach circuit has officially kicked off! With the announcements of our brand new 'ACL Regionals' events, mixed in with our traditionally online events, you now have more chances then ever to secure season points for a better ranking at our national tournaments. With the 2011 season just wrapped up and Immunity being announced the 2011 Halo Reach champions who has what it takes to take down the juggernauts this year? Don't miss your first opportunity to compete in an Online Round for 2012 and give yourself the best possible head start on the rest of the competition.






**What**

The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure ranking points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual score.

**Structure**


**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.


Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.


There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.






**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.
