**ACL Regionals for CoD: Mw3 & Halo Announced**





**The Australian Cyber League is proud to kickoff its 2012 Pro Circuit with a bang! As per last night's Starcraft 2 announcement, we are pleased to announce a game changing component to the entire season structure: ACL Regionals. This basically means that ACL has now 'Gone Local' and will be orchestrating not only 4 major National Events, but over 50 local events across our flagship titles from city to city in Australia this year! 





To celebrate this 2012 season launch, ACL staff will be travelling the country to run events for you guys in every major city!





Check out the latest Inside ACL for a look into what 2012 has in store:**

For those new to the Australian Cyber League, there are now 3 components to our competitions and season, each awarding points for your performance in these events.





- 
**ACL Regionals:**
 As announced, an open invite to compete for season points in each city.





- 
**Online Events:**
 An open invite for all to compete online against players in Australia & NZ.





- 
**National Events:**
 4 of these in 2012. The first has been announced as 
[ACL Gold Coast - Info here.](http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/topic/14850-acl-gold-coast-announced) These have the biggest attendance & biggest prizes.






**How the circuit will work in brief:**




You will earn points for every placing your team earns within the top 24 at each event you compete in during 2012. Each component of the competition has a varying weighting of points distribution.





The National events are still open to all teams, but seeded by your season points.





Everyone in each capital city will have 2 chances to accrue season points before the first national event. 1 x Qualifier (ACL Regionals event) and 1 x Online Round before ACL Gold Coast in January 21-22.
