**Vibe:** I first starting playing halo 2 at mates house. I’d usually go over there once a week with a group of mates and just play halo 2 customs all night. When halo 3 came out I still didn’t own a 360  that was when one of my mates got a 360 so I went over to try out halo 3. I Found it so much fun so I deiced to get a 360. Then I played halo 3 for a while mostly with Americans, then I slowly got into MLG. I ended up finding a few Australian’s searching in MLG thats when I got into Australian MLG customs.





I first heard about ACL about 2 years ago I used to play a fair of halo 3 with kerem (haunted) and he found a team with some players on ACL so thats where I first heard about it. I always wanted to play in a serious team but never had the time as I was too busy with school, sports ect.
