For this competition we have released specific rules for FFA tournament play. EVERYONE is required to read these rules and abide by them as there will be no excuses for not doing so come tournament time. All participants are required to have 'ACL Beware' and 'aclpro com au' added to their friends list as they will be the referees for this competition. 





Good luck to all participants.
