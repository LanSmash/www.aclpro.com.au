**2011 GAMES**




The main event this year will be SUPER STREET FIGHTER IV: ARCADE EDITION and will feature a 1v1 tournament, the always fun and exciting 3v3 tournament and plenty of tense exhibition matches such as the annual MELBOURNE vs SYDNEY and AUSTRALIA vs THE WORLD. SSFIV:AE will be played on the Xbox 360 console. Reigning champion; TTC|GamerBee from Taiwan will be making a return to defend his title.





MARVEL vs CAPCOM 3 will be making it's debut at a Shadowloo event this year and everyone is out to become the first Shadowloo MvC3 champion! We will also be seeing plenty of MvC3 exhibitions such as the MELBOURNE vs QUEENSLAND. Queensland players consider themselves as the premium Marvel players here in Australia, so plenty will be watching to see whether Queensland can talk the talk. MvC3 will be played on the Xbox 360 console.





Joining SSFIV:AE and MvC3 in the 2D department is BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II which will be played on the Playstation 3 console and Street Fighter III: 3rd Stirke which will be played on BlastCity arcade cabinets. TTC|Tokido from Japan who took out both BB:CS and SFIII:3s last Shadowloo Showdown will be return to try and win these tournaments for a second year running.





Tekken 6 will be returning to Shadowloo Showdown for another year to cover the 3D fighters department. Unlike last Shadowloo Showdown though, Tekken 6 will be played on the Playstation 3 console instead of an arcade cabinet. Can TTC|Tokido take out T6 again, or will someone step up and take the crown?..
