**Halo has long been our flagship game here at ACL, and while traditional 4v4s have always been the main attraction to our competitors, this year we have kicked off a brand new Halo Reach Free For All Pro Circuit. Like our 4v4 tournaments, FFA tournaments will be held online and be played at LAN events all throughout the year. Not only does this add more fierce competition to the ACLPro Circuit, it also allows new and up and coming players a chance to prove themselves amongst some of the most experienced and skilled veteran players in Australia. FFA is a very different game to 4v4, while in 4v4s you must rely on advanced communication and teamwork, in FFA you must rely only on yourself and your own individual skill.**




Australian Cyber League has already held an ACL Reach FFA Online Round 1 tournament as well as a Reach FFA Tournament at ACL Melbourne. These tournaments saw some of our most experienced and skilled players dominate the field, but also opened up the gates for some new talent to rise up amongst the ACL ranks and prove themselves as truly talented players. To view results and statistics from these two tournaments see Online Round 1 results

**Round 1**

ACL Halo Reach FFA Online Round 2 saw 88 of the best and most skilled players in Australia sign up for a chance to prove themselves amongst the ACL ranks.  All were aiming for that enticing first place finish and a chance to earn the right to title of the best in Australia. The first round of the tournament saw all competitors split into 11 pools and with the competition split this wide it gave some of ACLs finest the opportunity go on a demolition run in their opening match of the day on Zealot. We saw players such as Magician +19 and Benno +24 dominating their first pools, but no two players doing as well as Tranquillity +31 and KandeeCane +32 both putting up an impressive 65 kills. 






**Round 2**

After round 1 of the tournament we saw the competition pool split in half, where the top players from each pool would head into Tier A round 2, and the rest would begin their journey through the Tier B competition.  Round 2 of the Tier A tournament saw even tighter competition where all players had enough skill to take out the wins in their own pools. Prophet was the selected map of Round 2 and even with the mixed opinions from our players it didn’t stop some of them putting on a show with Tranquility, Vital Notion and Blaze all putting up an impressive +17, Monk showing off a +19, and Talent boasting a huge +21. Unfortunately this would be the end of the line for some competitors, as FFA has no ‘Losers Bracket’, but congratulations for all who made it this far within such a vast sea of talent.






**Quarter Finals**

Next up was the Quarter Finals of the FFA tournament, the best of the best were split into 3 pools of 24 players, but only 16 would progress to the Semi Finals. Zealot would be the battleground for our Quarter Finalists, and having come so far already all would be dreading going home early. After 15 minutes of hard fought Halo we had three clear winners of each pool in Blaze going +12, Benno putting up the +13 and Deano executing a ridiculous +26 putting up a huge 66 kills. 






**Semi-Finals**

If you make it to the Semi-Finals of a competition there is nothing more disappointing than not progressing to the Grand Finals, unfortunately that was the reality for half of our players in the FFA Semi-Finals. In Pool A the results were: 






**1.)**
 Tranquillity +14



**2.)**
 Vital Notion +7



**3.)**
 Lunar -7



**4.)**
 Hopey +5





Who all progressed through to the Finals, while unfortunately Pulse, Deano, Lil Virus and Bulk just falling short. In Pool B we had: 






**1.)**
 Talent +9



**2.)**
 Benno +10



**3.)**
 Monk +3



**4.)**
 Kryptic 0





Who all confirmed their position in the Finals and unluckily for Blaze, Dark, Fade and Jayce not being able to secure a spot. That finalised the Semi Final results for the ACL Reach FFA Online Round 2 competition with:






**9.)**
 Pulse



**10.)**
 Blaze



**11.)**
 Deano 



**12.)**
 Dark



**13.)**
 Lil Virus



**14.)**
 Fade



**15.)**
 Bulk



**16.)**
 Jayce 






**Grand Final**

The Grand Final was set up to be an epic match up, consisting of 8 of the most talented players who had proved themselves throughout the tournament and arguably some the best Reach players in Australia. As per the rules a vote was held before the match to decide which map would be played in the Finals and Prophet quickly earned 5 quotes before even asking all 8 players. The first 5 minutes of the match it was neck and neck with Hopey, Benno, Monk and Lunar all taking turns having the lead. After the 5 minute mark Benno managed to break away by a few kills and held it majority of the time up until the 10 minute mark. Hopey and Benno seemed to be neck and neck from 10 minutes on, both players seeming to go kill for kill to tie up the lead. This went on all the way up to 13.50 mark where Benno managed to again secure himself a small lead and was able to maintain that lead until the end of the match. Although in the dying minutes of the game it seemed to be only Benno and Hopey who would be the players to take it out, Lunar, Tranquillity and Talent where never too far behind, showing the incredibly even level of skill and competition in the Grand Finals match. The Final Results of the Top 8 of the ACL Reach FFA Online Round 2 tournament were:






**1.)**
 Benno



**2.)**
 Hopey



**3.)**
 Lunar



**4.)**
 Tranquility



**5.)**
 Talent



**6.)**
 Monk



**7.)**
 Vital Notion



**8.)**
 Kryptic
