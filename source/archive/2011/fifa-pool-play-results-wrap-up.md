Pool play for FIFA 11 has just concluded with several notable players jumping out to the front, going through undefeated.





With the biggest turnout for a FIFA game that we have seen yet, Muzza, Skip and Humpty have all emerged from pool play without dropping a game.





Finishing with a differential of +33 goals, Muzza is statistically the best in the field. That being said, Skip, fresh off his 3rd place finish at the FIFA Interactive World Cup in Los Angeles, finished with a differential of +33 goals.





Having competed against the best players in the world, Skip noted that the talent at ACL Sydney is incredibly impressive





“I’ve been to state championships and qualifiers for several years now, and I’ve never seen so many quality players in the one room together as I have seen today,” Skip noted.





“Players like Brett, Cripsy and Muzza are all great competitors. There’s a lot of pressure on me playing here after my performance at the FIFA Interactive World Cup and I’m definitely feeling it.”





ACL Melbourne champion Cripsy is currently sitting in equal 4th after pool play, with a +13 goal differential.
