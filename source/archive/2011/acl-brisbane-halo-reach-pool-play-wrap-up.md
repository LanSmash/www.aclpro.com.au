Halo: Reach 4v4 pool play has just finished up here at ACL Brisbane, with the seeds now set for the double elimination bracket, scheduled to kick off tonight.





Going into pool play, the teams to look out for were undoubtedly Razer Mindfreak, Vox Eminor, New Era, Break Even and the recently reshuffled defending champions, Team Immunity, featuring previous MLG National Champion, Ogre 1. 





Playing the recently updated MLG v6 settings, games got underway a little after 10am.





In Pool A and Pool B, both New Era and Mindfreak.Razer swept through their respective pools without dropping a game, further warranting their titles as some of the best teams in Australia.





Pool C featured the recently sponsored Vox Eminor squad, looking to continue on from their impressive second placing at the last ACL Pro Circuit event in Sydney. They wasted no time in proving their skills, as they went through their pool without dropping a game against teams such as Substance Abuse and infamous.





Pool  D was undeniably the strongest pool in the tournament, consisting of the top seeded Team Immunity, BreakEven, and recently formed Team Boss. Whilst there were no surprises when Immunity made it through without losing a game, the series that most were interested in watching was Boss vs BreakEven. Boss, a recently formed team made up of former Halo 3 players Shockz and Mitchy, along with Deano and montage king Lunar went into the series as favourites in the eyes of many. Unfortunately for them they failed to live up to the expectations of the crowd and were bungled out in three straight games.





With these results all in the can, the pool have now been set for the double elimination bracket to begin, scheduled to kick off later tonight.
