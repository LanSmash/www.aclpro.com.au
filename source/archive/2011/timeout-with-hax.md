**Today Beware from ACL sit downs with Hax, the most recent member to the infused dynasty. Most of you might not know that Hax has been around the Australian Halo community for just as long as anyone, and today we get a very informed opinion of the past, present and future of Australian Halo.**





**ACL: Thanks for the interview Hax, can you start out by telling us a bit of information about yourself?**

 Infused

**ACL: Not everyone might know but you've been a part of the Australian Halo community for quite some time, and had a lot of success throughout your career. Can you tell us long how you've been gaming for and how you first got into playing Halo titles competitively?**





**Hax:** I've been competitively gaming since 2004 (locally), 2005 (nationally) and 2007 (internationally). Prior to that I gamed for fun through the 90s playing all the awesome games on the n64/play station, SC on my iMac and CS 1.5-1.6/War3 on PC from 2000-2004.





I got into halo when it was first released in Australia, I purchased an xbox just to play it. I began lanning with friends in late 2003/early 2004 and competed in the WA WCG Halo 1 (1v1) qualifier where I placed 2nd to my long time friend and former team mate "The X". That was the first halo lan tournament I competed in and what sparked my competitive drive.






**ACL: Can you tell us a bit about the Halo scene back then, how big or successful it was? What sort of tournaments did you have back then?**





**Hax:** I can't really speak about the Halo 1 competitive scene since that was centralised in Brisbane. In Perth I had a good group of school mates that would lan against other groups of friends from different schools, who we would consistently beat and trash talk haha -  those were my nub/fun days. I recall one time a local team literally throwing a couch at my friends Ice Spectre and Shiatsu in frustration. No one was harmed but it was amusing none the less

The H2 scene was really interesting since it was the first time Halo was available on xbox live and that brought out a whole array of different personalities and consequently a lot of drama. In terms of how big it was it fluctuated quite substantially: in 05 there were two major 4v4 Tournaments Bigpond and Aussiexbox which produced huge numbers (I think over 100 or competitors). I did not compete in these due to year 12 commitments at the time. The reason the numbers were so high was due to the large amount of social gamers that attended following the release of h2, back then there wasn't as much of a known community hierarchy and by that I mean most people thought they were the awesome and hence competed thinking they could win. Later in 05 there was WCG nationals which Cabel and Senyo won, there was about 12 2v2 teams that competed in that event as you had qualify by placing at state local events. Following WCG the competitive community died down a little as no major corporate sponsored events lay on horizon. This resulted in the birth of the original ACL - a community based organisation that run online events and a National LAN tournament in 2006. 





In 2006 there were online 4v4, online 2v2 and online FFA events using the double elim format most are familiar with today. Teams were also generally made of people from the same state with a few exceptions in cmx/nsk. The amount of competitive teams would have peaked mid 2006 at around 6 (NSK, NaP, CmX, DK, KMP, DTP) with about 12 teams in total competing at Nationals. Although the number appears low relative to recent ACL events and the Bigpond/Aussiexbox it was substantial in terms of the fact that the 6 teams were all considered to be fairly even prior to Nationals and no team was really the favourite going in. To summarise ACL Natioanls NSK won the 4v4 (Dante, Weazle, ToxicPie, Falcon), F8 won the FFA and I won the 1v1.

Hax - one of the most experienced and knowledgeable players in Australia.





**ACL: Tell us about the Halo 2 BBR. How long did it take you to get yourself to the top with that Team? And who was your top competition back in those days?**





**Hax:** BBR was formed following ACL Nationals in 2006. I recall sitting on the plane back from ACL Nationals (Sydney) in 2006 thinking that in order to get to no1 I had to seek out the best possible team mates and bring them together. After I arrived back home I contacted Adz (known as OMEGA ADZ back then) and Berserka whose respective teams, DK and DTP, had quit or were in the process of disbanding. Somehow Xantics also ended up on team and we competed in our first online event placing 2nd to team Complex who would remain our primary competition during late Halo2 era and Halo 3 era.  Following this Game1 was announced and we dropped Xantics and picked up Dante (who approached us for the recored haha). After that we won everything including a Cod2 and Cod4 competition until about mid 2009. I would say our main competition was complex during H2, TE during H3 in 2008 and then finally iNC who was first team to knock us off no1 since mid 2006 when they won their first online event.






**ACL: Transitioning from Halo 2 to Halo 3 BBR was still as dominate in early Halo 3 as it was in Halo 2. How did you and your Team find the transition? Did BBR like Halo 3 after playing Halo 2 for so long?**





**Hax:** To be honest we didn't like h3 that much but we were so focused on winning that it didn't really bother us until we started losing haha. I would say we had to work a lot harder in H3, most event wins felt like the culmination of a lot handwork whilst with H2 we basically wouldn't practice and still win. Its worth noting that both Dante/Bererska quit in early 2008 and thats when the most widely known BBR was born (myself/adz/dockoh/kself). Kself and Dockoh both hadn't been no1 before so regardless of whether or not they liked the game they both had an intense drive to practice which was a major component of our success at the time. Shoutout to Tom and Matty!!!






**ACL: For the first 2 years of Halo 3 BBR had huge success winning all LAN events and winning the majority of Online Event, really cementing BBR as the first Australian Halo Dynasty. BrisLAN 09 however saw BBR place third, their worse placing on LAN since Halo 3s release. What do you think the was the reason that lead to your third place finish? And why did the Dynasty of BBR disband following BrisLAN 09?**





**Hax:** There were a lot reasons but at the same time I hate making excuses so I'm just gonna go with the primary factor which was that we failed to develop the level of teamwork that TE and iNControl did. They simply worked harder and pushed the level of teamwork much higher than it had been before. The reason we disbanded was because competing was no longer fun and I suppose we had to much pride to continue losing - we had lost 2 previous online events as well so the lan was the just the final nail in coffin.






**ACL: After taking a short break at the end of Halo 3 everyone knows you are back and mean business. When starting playing competitively again it seemed like you had a preference of picking up 'new talent' as opposed to teaming with other Veteran Players such as yourself. Your Round 1 Team Hopey, Haunted, Aba and yourself, tells us a bit about that lineup and what it was like playing with that Team?**





**Hax:** I got the idea from the original iNC which I saw as a group of highly motivated younger players that sought to out-practice their opponents (they had the time by virtue of their age and circumstances). I tested it in early 2010 after reloaded with brad/monks/naxik but concluded that the gap between iNC and rest of community was too large to overcome at that point especially with the addition of Benno. I had also completely lost interest in competing and felt as if I was doing an injustice to my team mates by continuing to play. After having a substantial break I came back for reach and thought of all the times this would be best to try this idea out as it was a new game. I went through a series of interesting lineups until I ended up with the above mentioned one. I basically just scouted players who I thought had long term potential, the only exception was Aba who I had teamed with in past in Cod/GoW/Graw. I enjoyed the experience at the time since everyone was really motivated and optimistic about potential of the team. I saw Hopey as emerging top player and Haunted as a player with a good concept of how to play but lacking confidence at the time (since then he has improved drastically!). 






**ACL: In ACL Online Round 1 that BBR lineup placed Second, a successful and respectable placing but you guys were definitely aiming for First. Why do you think you guys fell short? Why do you think nE was the better team on the day?**





**Hax:** Once again not one for excuses so I'd say they had better team game then we did at the time. We perhaps over-thought the game which bred doubt among team members which affected performance. One thing that frustrated me about that event was the fact that Aba and myself had to run it on the day (no fault of ACL but rather some lame hackers) which added a lot more stress to competition. That said I doubt the result would have changed. 









Hax playing in Online Round 1 against Malice





**ACL: After Round 1 BBR made some line up changes trying to get the best roster they could. Before anything was set in stone however iNControl (now Infused) approached you about a position on their team. What was going through your head at that time when they asked you to join? And was it hard to leave BBR after how much hard work you guys had put in?**





**Hax:** I was like yesssss im no1 again, although at the same time I felt like I hadn't earned it and I had to prove myself again. It wasn't a hard choice, the dynasty that was BBR had ended after Brislan 2009, what followed was a series of experiments. None the less I respect all the hard work the preceding lineups put in. 






**ACL: So being on Infused must be incredibly exciting. The talent and possibilities for you guys are endless. How have you guys been going together? How do you find yourself fitting in on the Team?**





**Hax:** I think we are doing alright, we barely lose so thats obviously a good sign but at same time I feel as if we could be performing better if I was better at the game and didn't have an assignment after assignment in my third week of uni

**ACL: As everyone knows your Teammates Benno, Heff and Voltage attended MLG Columbus last year where they placed an incredible 17th place. The time and effort these guys have put into Halo is completely unmatched by any other players in Australia. Whats it like teaming with these guys? And how far do you think you have come personally since joining Infused?**





**Hax:** Basically Heff/Benno/Tage are ridiculously far ahead of everyone in the community. I don't think I'm anywhere near their level yet but I'm trying to work on that. At the moment I just try take in all advice they provide and add it to my game. A point to be made is that they think a lot more about the game than I previously thought. They analyse so many different situations and have an astounding level of team awareness/memory. My general play-style has shifted from passive to pretty much pushing most of the time, so thats an improvement but at the same time I lack the awareness they have so it's hard to know when to time some things. 






**ACL: You have been on the Best Halo 2, Halo 3 and now Halo Reach Team. I think we can easily say you are one of the most successful and talented players in Australia. How have you found playing Halo over all these years? Did you ever get bored of playing the series? And how did you keep yourself motivated to put in the hours and perfect your skills to be so dominate over the years?**





**Hax:** I've enjoyed it the whole time, regardless of Halo's faults it still kicks the shit out of any other competitive console game and also because I enjoy being better at something than others as vain as that sounds. I did sort of burnout after Reloaded 2010 but following a substantial break my drive returned.  I don't really care about the game as much as I care about winning, so as long as their competitions I should be able to stay motivated.






**ACL: How do you think the game has changed from being on Top from earlier Halo games to Reach? And how has the gaming community or scene changed?**





**Hax:** I feel that the whole competitive scene has become a lot more refined and integrated. Back when I started things were a lot more local, than they became state based and now teams are made up of players from all around the country. Another thing that fundamentally changed the competitive Halo was Theatre. I find that top players are generally very analytical and this was godsend to them, allowing individuals and teams to understand consequences of decisions in real time over and over.






****ACL:**
 Ok looking forward to the first season of Halo Reach, not just here at ACL but internationally as well. I'm sure I speak for most of the community when I ask we are dying to know when you guys will be competing overseas in European and MLG events?**





**Hax:** Unfortunately I can't confirm anything yet but the goal is to compete internationally at a euro event then possibly MLG.






**ACL: Looking locally now, ACL Melbourne is just around the corner. Obviously Infused are the fan favourite to take out First place. What teams do you think will contest you the hardest? And what players in the ACL community outside of Infused really impress you?**





**Hax:** Fray are practising hard and will definitely be playing us in the finals outside of them I'm quite ignorant as to who is good now haha sorry about that.






**ACL: There will also be a Reach FFA Competition at ACL Melbourne and I know your teammate Benno is counting on the prize money for a good time in Melbourne. Who would you tip to take out the FFA Comp? And can you list some players you would expect to see in the FFA Finals?**





**Hax:** Benno, Tage, Hef, Hopey, Haunted, Natural Talent, Fade and hopefully myself

**Lastly, the MLG v3 settings have just recently been released. From what you have seen so far what do you like and dislike about the v3 settings? Anything you wished MLG would have put in and they didn't?**





**Hax:** I wished MLG would take out sprint but other than that I just wanted a midship remake in. 






**ACL: Shoutouts?**





**Hax:** Everyone I've ever teamed with and Australian competitive community. Massive shoutout to SammyK and NatB, you guys are amazing and Melbourne wouldn’t be possible without you guys.
