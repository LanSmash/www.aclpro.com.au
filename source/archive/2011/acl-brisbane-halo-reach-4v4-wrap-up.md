The Halo: Reach 4v4 competition here at ACL Brisbane has now come to an end and to no one’s surprise, Team Immunity have once again come up on top, doing so undefeated.





With a new look squad, now featuring Ogre 1 instead of Slayer, Team Immunity have proven once again that they are still the undisputed top team in Halo: Reach in Australia.





Throughout the early rounds of double elimination, the top teams such as BreakEven, Vox Eminor, Mindfreak.Razer and BOSS progressed steadily through their segments of the bracket. 





The first big meeting of the top teams occurred in Winners Bracket Round 3, when BOSS came up against, Immunity. As expected, Immunity defeated BOSS 3-0, however this was by no means an easy win. Later, Voltage would speak of how impressed he was by the ability of BOSS, especially considering that the line-up had only come together in such a short period of time.





With BOSS now down in the losers bracket, Mindfreak would face New Era in Winners Bracket Round 4. Despite some close games, Mindfreak would ultimately prove the stronger team, winning the series 3-1, whilst Immunity made swift work of Vox Eminor, 3-0.





With the Losers Bracket now populated by many of the top teams, all focus was on the match-up between New Era and BOSS. Despite being the first of the top teams being sent to the losers bracket, BOSS came out firing and never looked back, downing New Era in a dominating 3-0 fashion.





Meanwhile, Vox Eminor would face Break Even in one of the most intense series of the weekend. Whilst many expected Vox Eminor to defeat the Break Even squad, based simply upon experience, a well as the impressive performance they put on at ACL Sydney, it came as a real shock when Break Even came through to win 3-2. Vox Eminor were now out of the tournament, finishing a disappointing 5th.





Break Even would now face BOSS in the Losers Bracket semifinal, with many expecting the sheer experience of the Break Even squad to easily outweigh that of the recently formed BOSS squad. Expectations were swiftly proved wrong, however, with the series going back and forth, and ultimately ending up at 2-2 before going in to a decisive game 5. Fortunately for Break Even, game 5 was Team Slayer on The Pit, which would ultimately favour them due to the wealth of experience the team has had on the same map in Halo 3. BOSS never really provided much of a threat in this game, and ultimately shut the series out 3-2, advancing to the Losers Bracket Finals.





Having been clean swept 3-0 by Immunity, Mindfreak.Razer now found themselves in the Losers Bracket Finals, up against BreakEven. Keen to make up for their mistakes against Immunity, Mindfreak.Razer came out with all guns blazing and never looked back, making quick work of BOSS and sending them out of the competition with an amicable 4th place finish.





The scene was set for the Grand Final, with Immunity going up against Mindfreak.Razer in a continuation of their previous series. Continuing their dominant fashion, Immunity turned on the afterburners, instantly removing any chance of a comeback, taking out the entire tournament without dropping a single game.





The title of National Champions is the third event in a row for Heff and Voltage, the 2nd for Benno, and the first for new star recruit, Ogre 1.





Over all, ACL Brisbane has been a fantastic success, with an incredible turn out, intense games, and great viewer numbers watching the stream.
