New Store Now Open!





**ACL is pleased to bring you a new store system for 2011. As you all know, we are increasing our merchandise range this year and to come with it is a shiny new store system. Some of you may have already been browsing the new layout, complete with cart and checkout system. The store will link your purchases to your account and mean automatic upgrades for VoD subscriptions this year too!**





**Key Features:**





- Shop links to your ACL account


- Pay through PayPal or Direct Deposit


- Shipping information


- Up to date stock information


- Support contact system built in





To start off, the new ACL shirts are available for sale. Snap yours up before your size runs out! Remember, all proceeds from merchandise sales go back into making an awesome community even better!





Check out the new store, located next to 'about' on the main navigation bar today
