**Today ACL is proud to announce European organisation 
[apeX-esports](http://www.apex-esports.de/) as the sponsor of reigning ACL FIFA champion, Cripsy.**




Cripsy has been around the Australian competitive gaming scene for the past three years, where he helped launch FIFA as one of Australian Cyber League's competitive titles. His competitive Fifa 11 achievements include winning the exhibition event at the 2010 ACL National Championships in Brisbane, and more recently took out the championship at ACL Melbourne against some of the Australia's best FIFA players.





Cripsy said that the sponsorship is a great indication of the growing prominence of ACL.





"
It's fantastic news not just personally but for the growth of ACL and apeX" Cripsy reports. 





"
I hope to see more of these sponsorships for Australian FIFA players in the near future, creating an even more competitive environment for the top-end players. I would say to all competitive gamers especially FIFA players in the ACL community to get your name out there.





"
I'd like to thank apeX-eSports for taking me on board their fantastic team, hopefully I can continue to raise their profile as one of the best teams in the world. I'd also like to say a quick thank you to the ACL staff who work tirelessly to make each event, both LAN and online, run so well. I'd also like to acknowledge the ever-growing FIFA community at ACL, as well as the rest of the community for supporting ACL FIFA at events, on the live stream and the forums."





The next ACL event for FIFA is FIFA 11 Online Round 2 and the next ACL LAN event which will hold some of the best FIFA players in Australia is in Sydney on July 2nd and 3rd.
