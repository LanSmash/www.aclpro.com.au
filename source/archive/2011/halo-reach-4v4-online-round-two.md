**The second Halo: Reach 4v4 online event of the 2011 circuit has been announced for early June!**




Sharpen those Designated Marksman Rifles, polish those Sniper Rifle scopes, ACL Halo Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 is here! With ACL Melbourne just gone and a few months till the next ACL LAN event this is a great chance to earn valuable circuit points which will help to improve your seed for the 2011 season! This tournament is crucial for those teams who were unable to attend ACL Melbourne and don't want to lag behind the competition all year in the rankings. A solid performance here may be enough to bump you up to the Pro bracket, meaning you will avoid having to fight your way out of the Open bracket for the rest of the year.






**What**

The ACL online tournaments serve as a great way for teams to secure ranking points, which will then gain them a better seed at LAN events and future online tournaments. The higher you place, the more points you earn. Each player receives the same amount of points as the rest of their team mates (dependent on their placings), so if a player wishes to go and form another team for the next event, they will carry over their own individual score.

**Structure**


**Pool Play - Best of 3 Series**


Each Pool will have (tba - usually between 4-5) teams. This is dependent on numbers and could change.


Each series MUST play ALL 3 games.


There is only one round of Pool Play. This means you will only play teams inside your pool before this stage of the competition ends. Upon completion of Pool Play you will either be knocked out or progress to the next stage. The reason you are playing all 3 games in a series is to better determine win/loss ratios. Your team may be required to play a tiebreaker game to determine seed for the next stage.






**Double Elimination - Best of 5 Series**


Each team does NOT need to play all 5 games if a result occurs after 3 games. Lose one series to enter the Losers Bracket. Lose another series and you will enter Placement Rounds. Placement Rounds will then determine Overall Points for your placing in the top 16.
