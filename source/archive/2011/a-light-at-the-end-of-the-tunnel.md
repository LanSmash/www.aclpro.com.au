Never have I been more motivated to work towards the future of Australian gaming. AusHalo ’09 was the event that started it all. A competition that was fresh, bold and exciting, it was groundbreaking in Australia and no gaming event even came close until the Melbourne and Sydney stops of ACL’s 2011 circuit. That was, until the EB Games Expo.





This event was to gaming what Woodstock was to music. It opened my eyes to the world of commercialised gaming and showed me what “mainstream” actually meant. In the world of gaming, a few well-known brands and companies spring to mind. Xbox, Sony, Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Activision, BioWare, 343 industries, Bethesda, Ubisoft and the list goes on. Out of all of these companies, there was not one that wasn’t represented at the EB Expo. Not one.





Hopefully you now have a grasp of how big this event actually was. The event saw over 16,000 people attend over two days and I must say, it was a very nice feeling to be surrounded by so many like minded people. These people, who have the same passion and drive for gaming, who spend their hard earned money to come to this Expo, if you leave out the fact that I was working then you might say I was in a gamer’s heaven.





What I really loved about this event wasn’t just the awesome stands or give-aways, it wasn’t the perks that came with my job, it wasn’t even seeing the very attractive lady cos-playing Tifa from Final Fantasy. No, it was the reminder that came with this Expo, the reminder that gaming is very much alive and so very much on the rise. Any doubt in my mind about the future of ACL was at that moment, washed away forever.





You see, as a member of staff in ACL and one of the founding members of what is to be “ACL House”, I would be lying if I said I didn’t have my doubts or that I wasn’t a little worried. I think it’s natural. We all make sacrifices and for some of us, change our habits, lives or even the state we live in, just to see the best for the future of ACL and Australian Gaming as a whole. We didn’t see exponential growth in LAN attendance nor did we see servers crash from too many people watching our stream, however, there were very noticeable and marked changes to our organisation and I think that has changed many things for the positive. We’ve seen increases in our numbers and the quality of our content. EB Expo however, has pushed me over the line.





We all talk about what we want for the future, what we are planning for and how we are going to do it. This is all great and we all want it but it was simply fantastic to see those kinds of numbers at a gaming event. Granted, they weren’t all into ACL’s supported titles and they may not all be into competitive gaming, it does however give me the hope and drive for the future, It shows me that they may not be on ACL yet and they may not be watching our tournaments on our stream, but the gamers are there.





Countless times while working on the Halo: Anniversary booth was I approached by enthusiastic people, of all ages, races, male or female, who all wanted to “kick each other’s butts”. It brought a smile to my face, but not as much as two young lads, no older than 10, who came into the booth on Saturday morning. I overheard one of them, as he finished killing his mate in Halo, say, very excitedly, “I wish there was a competition at this, I’d beat everyone!”. When I walked up to him, I said “Did you know there actually is? I help to run that competition.” He then continued to tell me how he’d be the best at it. If you punched me in the face or hurt a small puppy, you still wouldn’t be able to wipe the smile off my face after that brief conversation.





I look forward to a day where an ACL event will be as much of a drawcard for gamers as EB Expo was. It was such an impressive event and showcased the best of Australian gaming. I am sure that with the support of our current member base along with the dedication and enthusiasm of staff and volunteers, we can make ACL into an organisation that thousands will call the home of Australian gaming, long into the future. Here’s to 2012.
