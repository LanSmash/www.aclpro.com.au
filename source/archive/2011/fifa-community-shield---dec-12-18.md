**The first FIFA 12 competition for ACL has arrived and much like the real life Community Shield that kicks off the EPL, it is to kick off a new season of FIFA for ACL!**




Players from around Australia now have the chance to not only compete for pride and bragging rights, but thanks to 
[DB Gaming Gear](http://dbgaminggear.com.au/) they will be fighting it out for store credit at a minimum worth of $100 in value! Even with this being the case, the Community Shield is still free to compete in. The Community Shield will NOT count towards 2012 season points for FIFA 12 on ACL.



**Prize pool will increase if we receive over 32 playing entrants, be sure to tell your friends.**





A confirmation thread will be released on the 7th of December and if you want to compete you MUST confirm yourself.









**Structure and Rules**





No teams are banned and all games must be played through Online Friendlies. Players MUST use online squads only, if you are found exploiting or cheating you will be disqualified AND may be banned from future ACL events. Following previous successful ACL tournaments the Community Shield will follow a pool play/double elimination process, with the pool play results deciding the seeds for the double elimination. Pools and and the double elimination bracket can be found in the Master Thread linked below prior to the tournament commencing.









Pool Play:




During pool play, You must play each opponent in your pool twice with each player playing home once. The normal points will apply as per the FIFA 11 season with the only change being draws are now called after 90 minutes which means that the following points for pool play now apply: 3 points being handed out for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss. Pool Play will commence on the morning of Monday the 12th of December  and the final games must be finished before Thursday the 15th at 11:59pm. 





On Friday the 16th any playoff matches will be played to determine and finalize the seeds for the double elimination bracket. 









Double Elimination:




The double elimination bracket will run throughout the following weekend beginning at 7pm on Saturday the 17th and concluding the following  night with games to be played from 7pm on Sunday the 18th.








Competitors please keep note that you have 15 minutes after the designated start time before you forfeit your games in the double elimination bracket, so If you are going to be late, please let a competition admin know, or post in the master thread located *here*. All times are in AED (Sydney/Melbourne) Time.
