**ASiKK & ACLPro Present :: ACLPro Community Montage - 100% MLG**





**Back in November of last year people of the ACLPro community and the Australian gaming community in general had an opportunity to submit their best MLG clips to be in the running to be selected for the ACLPro Community Montage. From there your clips were to be reviewed and only the best would be chosen to be showcased in the most impressive Australian Halo Reach Montage to date. Thanks to the tireless efforts of Asikk and Doofus the ACLPro Community montage is finally complete for you all to see. Sit back and enjoy!**
