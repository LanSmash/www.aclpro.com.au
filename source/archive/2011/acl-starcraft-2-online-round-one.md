**FORMAT:**




The competition will have open group stages to any player wishing to participate. Some players who participated in ACL Regionals will only be required to compete in the double bracket elimination. The amount of pre-seeded players, and double bracket elimination specifics will be announced later this week. Be sure to check back on this space for updated tournament details.









**SEASON POINTS & SEEDING:**




For those that could not attend an ACL Regionals event, if you finish in a points attaining position (1st - 32nd) you will receive 150% of points. If you did attend an ACL Regionals event, you will receive 100% of points allocation.





These points will combine with your ACL Regionals points (if any) to seed your ranking at the first Nationals event on the Gold Coast. The top 16 players, by seeding points, will be invited to compete here in the Pro bracket. Please bear in mind that an Open bracket system will be in place at the Gold Coast (but again to limited numbers).
