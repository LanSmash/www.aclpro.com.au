**Soniq Release Free Android Games and Promotes ACL on Their Website!**







ACL is proud to announce to its members the launch of two free games for Android mobile devices thanks to Soniq.





Since starting a relationship with ACL and supplying 2 x 42inch screens for ACL's main stage, the TV manufacturer continues to support us through cross promotion on their website
