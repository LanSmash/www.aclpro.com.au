**Official 2011 ACLPro Circuit FFA Halo Reach Forge Competition**





**Like to mess around in Forge? Got a self-created map you've been playing around with? Hardcore Forger? Look no further. Today ACL is giving you the opportunity to submit your very own Map specifically forged for competitive FFA play. You will have the chance to be featured on our very own Reach FFA Pro Circuit and receive the recognition and prize you deserve!**






**Overview:**

This competition has been delayed in await of the impending release of the MLG v3 settings so Forgers know which settings (Player Speed, Jump Height, Gravity etc) to forge their Maps for. Since v3 has still not been released and we'd like to have your map ready in time for ACL Melbourne we are going to base all the player movements on the MLG v3 Test settings (of which details are listed below). If this deadline is proven to be too soon, then the competition will extend past ACL Melbourne to a month before ACL FFA Reach Online Round 2. Don't forget Sprint is confirmed for v3 settings so be certain to make sure your maps are suitable for Sprint! Be sure to use the test ACL FFA Gametype to test out your map, find it 
[**here**](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/FileDetails.aspx?fid=14137001&player=ACL%20Beware).





At the moment the we only have one Map on our ACLPro FFA Reach Circuit and we'd like to provide another to add more entertainment and variety for all our competitors, cause lets face it one map can get stale after a while. The map we have at the moment is the FFA MLG variant of Zealot, this map can be found 
[**here**](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/FileDetails.aspx?fid=4287964&player=MLG%20Gametypes). 





Now as stated above all the submitted Maps must be specifically designed for FFA play-style. This doesn't mean you can't turn a 4v4 map you've made into a fantastic FFA Map, just that it must run smoothly and fairly in an FFA environment. 





The map MUST be forged on Forge World, and must have absolutely NO frame rate-lag. Your maps will be tested over and over and if any frame-rate lag is found your map will automatically be out of the running of the competition. The reason Forge World is the only map we will accept for submission is because not all players have the new DLC maps and none of the original maps accept Zealot suit FFA playstyle. So its entirely up to your own creative mind and a big and vast Forge World!





Map size is left up to the digression of the Forger but obviously maps too big/small will affect how successfully the map plays, so be sure to get the size right in the early stages of your forge design. It would be a shame to have to completely start from scratch to fix your map!





You may post your Map/s in this thread to request play-testers and obtain feedback between now and before the closing submission date, but when you are officially entering your map for submission you must send myself (Beware) a PM with the title "Official FFA Map Submission". You can PM me
