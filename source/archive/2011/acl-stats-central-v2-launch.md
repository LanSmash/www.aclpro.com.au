We will be launching V2 of Stats Central today, so I thought I would let you all know what you can expect, and what you can be looking forward to in the future.





First off, the major change is that we're taking Stats Central from just Halo to a multi game statistics service. So it will truely be Stats Central for all things ACL. If ACL has a game on its circuit, then it will be represented in Stats Central now. Some in more involved ways than others.

Right off the bat today, some of the sections will be lacking a bit in content, this is due to the fact that we havent had the time to enter the new information to the new system yet. But we wanted to get it out so you could see for yourselves what is coming as we enter the data. So, as some of the data is yet to be enterred for certain games, there are places where it will be pre loaded with Halo data so you can get the feel for it. Rest assured this will be a VERY temporary and will we have the proper stats in there ASAP.





Apart from the change to add in multiple games, there are now a few more changes, with more to come soon in the pipeline:


- From your profile page you will now be able to see which games you play/played and your stats for each game as well as a link to all matches played.


- The home page will now have a summary of all titles.


- There will be more stats pages you can check to see how your rank against Australias best!





Things nearing completion


- Detailed stats for new games


- Lots more detail for each players profile.


- Stats Archive for previous seasons





Starting work on soon


- Swiss system display for fighters


- Thinking about adding in medals/awards for things in tournaments (perfections etc) that will be shown on player profiles.





So, we hope you like V2, and over the coming weeks we cannot wait to show you its full potential.
