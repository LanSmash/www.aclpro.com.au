**Avermedia Game Caputre HD Unboxing and Set-up Tutorial**








**The Avermedia Game Capture HD is the latest device on the market to capture your gameplay with one touch recording. It really is so simple to use. This video shows you what's in the box and how to get recording quickly.**







Thanks to Avermedia we were lucky enough to receive a review unit, so as you can see in the video we decided to take it down to ACL Regionals in Brisbane and open it up to share with you guys. One of the best features of this device is its truly portable nature. You can easily take this anywhere and record up to 1080i HD quality picture with one touch!
