With ACL Melbourne wrapped up, ACL's FIFA 11 season takes the next step to Online Round 2. After the successful finish to the first FIFA 11 LAN, we are looking to make Online Round 2 bigger, better and more competitive than any previous ACL FIFA 11 competition!





For more information on ACL FIFA 11 Online R2, visit the official tournament landing page 
[HERE](http://www.aclpro.com.au/2011/events/fifa/fifa-r2-landing-page).





This tournament will include a new format which will be used for all future FIFA 11 Online competitions. Essentially there is a Pro bracket for the Top 8 players based on seeding points from previous tournaments as well as an Open bracket for every player outside the Top 8. The Top 8 players from the Open bracket will meet the Pro bracket players in the finals.

Saturday, June 4th, 11am AEST Until Completed






**Pro Double Elimination:**





Sunday, June 5th, 11am AEST Until Completed





The times mentioned above means you are 
**READY TO PLAY**
 at those times. For every 15 minutes you are late, you forfeit a game. This only applies for Open and Pro Double Elimination games, pool play games can be completed at your leisure so long as they are completed in the designated time frame.








This competition is for overall points in the season, exactly like Halo and CoD. If you're topping the ladder at the end of the season you will be regarded as the best FIFA player in Australia!
