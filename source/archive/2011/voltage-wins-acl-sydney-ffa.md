The Reach Free For All is over here at ACL Sydney, with Voltage from Team Immunity emerging victorious.





Breaking a 4 event hoodoo held by team-mate Benno, Voltage emerged just four kills clear of his nearest rival, Pulse, to claim the title.





Solid grenades and some lucky triple kills were enough to get Voltage over the line for his first ever FFA victory.





"I just held top middle as much as I could and worked to get grenades on the ramps as much as possible," said Voltage.





"It feels good, and I feel like my individual game has improved really considerably since Melbourne".





Voltage will travel with the rest of Team Immunity to compete at MLG Anaheim later this month to compete at Major League Gaming. 





"We’ve been practicing a lot and we’re feeling really confident," he said.





"Nothing is set in stone yet but we’re looking at having a pre-LAN with Ninja’s team (which includes Walshy and Best Man)."





Other notable performers in the FFA include young up-and-comers Cheez and Jayce, both posting respectable scores.





With FFA now out of the way, the Halo: Reach 4v4 is scheduled to soon get underway. Stay tuned to www.aclpro.com.au for more info.
