The Double Elimination bracket is well underway for Halo: Reach here at ACL Sydney, with several notable results already recorded.





In Round 2 of Double Elimination, we saw Team Distinctive (Crux. Mantis, Halvo and Haze) sending Break Even down to the losers bracket much earlier than anticipated with a 3-1 victory. Break Even, who entered the tournament with a large amount of optimism after solid pre-LAN results, were fairly disappointed, having tasted a lot of success as a team in Halo 3.





Continuing the trend of upsets in Double Elimination of Round 2, New Era (Vibe, Fade, Blaze, Natural Talent), who finished in 3rd place at ACL Melbourne, were bundled down to the losers bracket by  Initial Concept (Jim, Tranquility, Stryfe and Jayce). Adding to the shock of this result was the fact that this Initial Concept result was put together rather late, with Jayce joining only weeks before the event began.





No Remorse (Fearless, Omen, Killself and Godlike) surprised many  by claiming the 6th seed in the Double Elimination bracket, however their shock run was hindered somewhat by a 3-0 loss to Death Eaters (Hopey, Chantelle, Dark and Karloo).





New Era, after falling shockingly to the losers bracket late yesterday are still in the mix after defeating Infamous 3-0.





The real story of today has just come from Winners Bracket Round 3 which took place on the ACL Sydney Mainstage between the previously mentioned Team Distinctive and top-seeded Team Fury (Asikk, Cheez, Monk and Demon). Having toppled the much-favoured Team Immunity in pool play yesterday, few thought Team Fury would have many issues in making it through the Winners Bracket Round 4. Distinctive, however, had other plans.





With Team Fury racing off to a quick 2-0 game lead in the series, it looked like we’d be witnessing a comprehensive shutout. Not to be embarrassed, Team Distinctive would rally in Game 3 to take Zealot Bomb 2-1 in a very dominating fashion.





As a strong crowd began to build in front of the ACL Mainstage, the nerves were behinning to show in the Team Fury camp. Distinctive would take a 4-1 lead into the final game. Some strong objective running from Monk would result in a flag throw to Cheez to take the score to 4-2, with Monk then securing the Active Camo to nab his team a third capture. However it was too little too late for Team Fury, as the clock would prove to be their main enemy, running out of regulation time.





 It would all come down to a final and deciding game on Countdown Team Slayer. Nothing could separate the teams at all for the entire game, with no team jumping ahead by anything more than six kills. The real different maker in the game would be Halvo’s use of the Active Camo, as he secured the final one to grant Distinctive top control and send them through to the next round with a 50-45 victory, sending the crowd into a frenzy.
