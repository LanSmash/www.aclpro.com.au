The first stop of the 2011 circuit, Melbourne, has just come and gone and can you believe we have already completed a third of this years' competition? With twists and turns, the circuit has seen an amazing and unexpected run out of the blocks this year. Proudly partnered with Razer now, ACLPro is looking forward to "taking it to the next level" with their assistance. For news on what went down in Melbourne

Lately, the ACL Pro team have been bombarded with numerous amounts of feedback from players that have competed in the previous online rounds and LAN's as well as general members of the community. There has been a mix of positive and constructive feedback from the community and we love hearing it. We appreciate your enthusiasm and support for the circuit and we have been listening. Because of this we are proud to announce another testing competition to allow the community to get involved and voice their opinions on changes that might be implemented into the circuit's future events.

**Connection Issues**

After some problems with connection issues we are taking a new approach in finding the best possible way to maintain a fair match. Please read below.






**Domination**


If a player disconnects in Domination, the team with the disconnected player has 10 seconds to decide if they are going to play a man down and try to invite him back in. If they choose to end the game, they are required to go to spectator mode, the game is ended and the scores are recorded. As a result of stopping the game they will suffer a penalty and the other team will be awarded an additional 15 points to their current score. The remaining time will be matched up with the nearest game setting available. They have 5 minutes to get there player back in or to find a replacement. After 5 minutes the match will be restarted and play out the remaining time.



**Capture the Flag**


If a player disconnects in Capture the Flag, end the match when both flags are returned to their home base at the same time. The scores are recorded and 1 flag is awarded to the other team. The remaining time of that half will be matched up with the nearest game setting available. They have 5 minutes to get there player back in or to find a replacement. After 5 minutes the match will be restarted and play out the remaining time.






**Search and Destroy**


If a player disconnects in Search and Destroy at the start of the round the team has to team kill immediately (within the first 10 to 15 seconds). If kills have occurred prior to the player disconnecting the match must continue on and if the team who lost a player starts team killing they will lose the round. If a player times out mid round the match will be ended at the conclusion of that round. They have 5 minutes to get there player back in or to find a replacement. After 5 minutes the match will be restarted and play out the remaining time.



All rules and decisions are at the discretion of the admin team all decisions are final
