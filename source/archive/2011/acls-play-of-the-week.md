**ACL announces its Play of The Week video service, with the help of Asikk and Omikron**







Instead of an irregular top 5 service, ACL has opted for something a little different, and more frequent. Once a week, the best play from any of the ACL supported games will be selected and then shown on Sunday.





Your clip can be from either Halo:Reach, CoD: Black Ops, Fifa 11, SSFIV, Super Smash Brothers or Marvel vs Capcom 3 and if selected, will go into ACL's official Play of The Week video, released each Sunday on ACL's official YouTube channel.





Submit your clips for review by Asikk, Omikron, Beware, Peteh and Vanzr.








PM your clips 
[HERE](http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/index.php?app=members&module=messaging&section=send&do=form&fromMemberID=572) to Hoggy for distribution to the voting team.








Get pumped for more exposure for your sick plays!
