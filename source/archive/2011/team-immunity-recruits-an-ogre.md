Team Immunity would like to announce an important update to their Halo line-up that has been representing Team Immunity over the year at many large competitions both nationally and internationally. Isaac ‘Slayer’ Turkovic will be stepping down from the line-up, and world renowned ex-Team 3d player Daniel ‘OGRE_1’ Ryan will be taking his place.





Daniel made a name for himself over the course of Halo 2 and 3 for Team3D; he has become one of the most recognised gamers in the Halo competitive scene. Daniel has recently moved to Australia and will be bringing plenty of experience and talent to the Team Immunity Halo line-up. The addition of Daniel to the Team Immunity line-up is a greatly welcomed enhancement to the already strong team.





On joining Team Immunity Daniel commented, 





‘
This has opened a door for me to get back into the competitive Halo scene, both on a national and international level, with a team and organisation that is motivated and whom I respect.’





Isaac steps down from his position, after being an integral part of the success Team Immunity has experienced over the year. Some of the great competitions he was involved with were the Australian Cyber League tournament, which is the largest Halo competition in Australia, and also at the Anaheim leg of Major League Gaming in the United States, which is the largest Halo competition in the world.





Team Immunity has a reputation for professionalism and top-tier player skill as seen throughout their performances, demeanour and practice routines. Daniel is a tried and tested eSports personality, who will add a wealth of ability and professionalism to the team. In regards to what he wants to achieve with Team Immunity, Daniel comments, “
I always expect great things of myself; I am looking to strength the team with structure and experience, so we can achieve greater things in the future.”





Team Immunity General Manager Lloyd ‘Swordfish’ Smith had this to say,





‘
It’s sad to see Isaac go, he has been a huge asset to the organisation in his short time here and we wish him the best in the future. In saying that, we’re very happy to be bringing Daniel into the roster - being such a recognised and experienced player that he is and can’t wait to see the newly established roster compete!’





With this line-up update Team Immunity will look to improve upon the standard they already have set for future tournaments both at home, here in Australia, and overseas.
