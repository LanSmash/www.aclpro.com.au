**Sporting My Controller**




Now here is a debate that has interested me for a while. A debate that has been around ever since Dustin "HP Darkman" Langton was the first “Pro Gamer” to be signed to MLG, or even since Johnathan “Fatal1ty” Wendel, considered to be the world’s first Pro Gamer, won his first cash prize of $4000 for coming 3rd at a Quake tournament in Dallas, Texas, back in 1999. I am of course talking about the debate: “Is Professional Gaming a real sport?”





I think we must first define “sport” and therein lies the problem. There are many, many variations of the definition of words, a few of which I’m going to list that have been found through online references:





“Physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively.”


-www.thefreedictionary.com





“An activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others.”


-www.google.com





“An athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.”


-www.dictionary.com





Now, these definitions are up to the individual to take in a literal or general sense. However, I think most will agree that a “sport”, no matter what the definition, has the following traits: A sport is a physical activity, usually competitive in nature, in which a certain level of skill is required. A sport may also involve spectators.





What may be surprising to some is that gaming, on a competitive level, actually fits very well into the definition of a “sport”. It requires physical skill, such as hand-eye coordination and reflexes. It can be extremely competitive and it can also attract spectators. So it seems, by definition, professional gaming can actually be called a sport. Although, if it was as straight forward as ripping a few dictionary definitions from some websites and slapping them copy-paste style into an article, the debate wouldn’t exist, would it?





A lot of the controversy and power against the argument that Pro Gaming is a sport comes from a very traditionalist point of view, however it is accepted it is a valid point. Most argue that Pro Gaming can’t be a sport because there is no “physical exertion”, one of the prerequisites to define something as a sport by many definitions.





To this point however, one may simply argue that using a controller or keyboard and mouse, even to the smallest degree, is still physical exertion. Given, it is very minimal exertion, yet it is still there nonetheless. Many Pro Gamers have reported having Repetitive Stress Injuries through gaming, some even needing to consult a physiotherapist. In this sense, the physical exertion between gaming and other “accepted sports” may be very similar.





Another argument many people make is that Pro Gaming can’t be a sport because they don’t train. They don’t shed blood, sweat and tears to become the peak of their sport. Contrary to this as most competitive gamers would know is that Pro Gaming actually takes a lot of training, practice and dedication. Again, traits shared with mainstream sports. Gamers could spend anywhere up to 10hrs a day practicing to become better at a game, arguably more time spent on training than any accepted sport.





The next argument is about spectators and this may be one of the strongest arguments. It’s a given fact that there are more people who watch sports than play them and many argue this is one of the key reasons that gaming isn’t a sport. A father can’t take his son to a local LAN in the same way he can take him to a local Football game, right?





If we take a step back and look at the progression of gaming leagues like MLG, or even here in Australia with the likes of ACL, the experience for spectators in competitive gaming is drastically improving and numbers are increasing all the time. You now pay to be a spectator at an MLG event in the same way you pay to watch a game of Football. Some may even argue, what is the difference?





Gaming, just as with sport, has garnered attention from the corporate world. Professional Gamers are now sponsored for thousands of dollars just as athletes of mainstream sports are. Competitive gaming has been televised and even now is streamed to literally millions of viewers online.





Personally, I have had this debate with friends and colleagues and one of the arguments I hear most is a traditionalist one: “How can gaming ever be a sport? Did your parents ever take you to a local park to watch a LAN?” My answer to this, usually accompanied by a sigh is “No.” However, maybe when I have children in the future, I may just be taking them to the local entertainment centre to watch the newest generation Walshys or Ogre Twins or Boxers or Fatal1tys.





To summarise, is gaming a sport? I believe it is a debate that will continue for years to come but in the end, I believe it boils down to this: 





If you treat Professional Gaming 
as a sport, it 
can be a sport.
