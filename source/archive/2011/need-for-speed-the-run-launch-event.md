**The Venue**




Last Thursday marked the epic launch of Need For Speed: The Run in Sydney’s Potts Point, at the luxurious Scuderia Graziani showroom. In layman’s terms: Where they sell high end sports cars and supercars like Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches. A cool venue it was indeed, pimped out with a Porsche and Lambo in the foyer, the rest of the showroom was cleared for a few other vital things required for an impressive launch: Red Bull DJ stand equipped with smoking hot DJ, Emily Scott, 14 TVs loaded up with the very cool NFS: The Run and of course beer, champagne and Red Bull!

From ACL we had myself, Parker, Nuguns, Cavey, Brett, Bramble and Pandan while Psykerpath and Weasel represented DB Gaming Gear. 





Earlier in the day I met up with Parker, Nuguns & Bramble as I had organised a few meetings with potential sponsors for ACL to coincide with the NFS launch. I sussed out the ACL Regionals venue in Sydney, which is a cracker by the way - centrally located! - then borrowed Parker's car to zip around Sydney. After checking in to our (very) cheap room for the evening, we quickly got ready and headed for a quick bite at Bar Broadway. A few beers and potato wedges later, we were on our way to the NFS launch.

**NFS: The Run**







Upon arrival the guy with the dreadlocks from 'The Shack' commented on how well dressed I was, to which I replied with silence. He picked up on this silence and commented : "just the reaction I was looking for, awkward silence". Following my social fail we proceeded inside to meet NFS Jiggsy - the man and legend who had set up the whole event and invited ACL members. He passed us our nametags and we moved straight inside to the bar.





Soon we caught up with the others from ACL and DB Gaming Gear, and a night of networking and social chat began. Not much more can be said other than we had a great time and Need For Speed looks mint!! A blast to play, high adrenaline, action racing. Sure, it's not a sim, but that's not what we wanted - we wanted some crazy, ultra performance supercars, and that is exactly what it delivered!!

**Porsche**




Not long before we left, we decided to ask the DJ whether ties were 'in' or not at these events, as Brett and I had decided they were. The DJ suggested otherwise, as we should have been going for the 'I've finished work and want to take this damned tie off look'. Vanz & Brett - 0. Emily Scott - 1. Little did I know, until searching for images just now, that Emily Scott used to be a model. You can check out her mixes and some of her former modelling shots here:

Unfortunately for the ACL crew, we were lacking professional photography equipment, so have stolen as much as we can from other websites to give you an insight into the event. Thanks to Auto Cult’s fantastic write up, you can see a bunch of great pics (we've ripped) here:

Anyway, this marks the conclusion to this wrap-up, which can be conclusively agreed upon by all as a GREAT NIGHT! Many thanks to NFSJiggsy for the hookup and EA Australia for always looking out for ACL!!
