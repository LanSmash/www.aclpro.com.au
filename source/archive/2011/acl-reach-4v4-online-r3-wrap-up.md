**ACL online events have always been a valuable part of the ACL Pro Circuit and provide the perfect balance between a fun weekend of gaming and a competitive tournament environment for the best players in ACL. Online competitions serve the purpose of providing players with valuable points to seed them in future LAN and online tournaments, accommodate players and teams that are unable to attend LANs, and constantly test who is the best team in Australia and New Zealand.**




ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 3 has just passed and featured 27 of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand battling for 1st place over September 2nd-4th. As per regular tournament segregation open pool play kicked off on the Friday Night of September 2nd and featured 19 teams fighting it out for valuable seeding ranks and the opportunity to progress the open double elimination tournament the next day.






**Friday**

The open pool play competition was spread out amongst 4 pools (3 pools of 5 and 1 pool of 4) and each pool provided some close fought and impressive competition. In pool A we had Fifth Degree, a team made up of players spread out all over Australia and ACL semi-pro Slazy take out their pool with an impressive 9-0 win loss ratio, going through their pool without dropping a game. In pool B we saw the biggest upset of the open pool play tournament in Take Aim consisting of some new and old blood (Hoggy, Oh Mitchy, Medler, Slam Dawg) take out their pool going undefeated after meeting up with Open Pool Play favourites Endure and narrowly taking them down 2-1. In Pool C we saw New Zealand team of Lord of the Rings and Team Guido's both go through pool C without dropping a game until they met up with each other in the last round where 'Lord of the Rings' took out the series 2-1, giving them the highest seed from Pool C. Last but not least Pool D saw another skilled New Zealand team in Team Chimera take out their pool only dropping one game to Pure Resistance, giving them the highest win/loss ratio and the pool win. When all open pool play battle had finished the seeding process had provided the top 16 best teams with seeding ranks for the next day open double elimination bracket, those seeding ranks are listed below:





1.) Fifth Degree


2.) Team Chimera


3.) Lord of the Rings


4.) Take Aim


5.) Endure

13.) Narcotic


14.) Stat-us Whore


15.) The Demonic Anarchy

**Saturday**

Next up was the competition on Saturday, which meant the open double elimination tournament and pro pool play. In the open double elimination we saw the above seeded teams facing off against each other in a standard double elimination format: 1v16, 2v15, 3v14, 4v13, 5v12, 6v11, 7v10, 8v9. In winners bracket round 1 the results were fairly typical with all games going in favour of the higher seed. From there half the talent dropped down to begin their fight through the losers bracket while the winning teams progressed through the winners bracket. Envious, Team Guido's and Lord of the Rings were all looking strong taking out their winners bracket round 2 matches 3-0, though when Endure and Take Aim met up for the second time in the tournament so far the match up went to a nail-biting 5 game series where yet again Take Aim emerged victorious taking the series 3-2. In winners bracket round 3 we saw Take Aim match up against Envious and Lord of the Rings match up against Team Guido's, from here Lord of the Rings proved they were too much for Team Guido's beating them 3-0 while Take Aim managed to take down Envious 3-2 in yet another close seires. This set up the winners bracket finals of the open double elimination tournament where Take Aim yet again displayed their ability to clutch best of 5 series taking down Lord of the Rings 3-2 in a very close fought match up. Battling out of the losers bracket however was Team Chimera, they managed to come back all the way from losers bracket round 2 to the losers bracket finals where they were scheduled to play off against Lord of the Rings, however due to the fact that Lord of the Rings members had to jump offline they forfeited the series to Team Chimera.  Unfortunately for Take Aim who were waiting in the Finals this also happened to their team, as as all their members weren't online to play they also had to forfeit the series to Team Chimer which awarded Team Chimera number 1 seed from the open double elimination bracket.



**The seeds from the open double elimination bracket are below:**




1.) Team Chimera 


2.) Take Aim


3.) LOTR


4.) Endure


5.) Team Guidos

While all the open double bracket elimination action was being played pro pool play was also going down where the Top 8 ranked teams going into ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round all played off against each other to determine seeding ranks for the pro double elimination series on Sunday. Two of the strongest teams in pro pool play, Mindfreak.RAZER and Team Sidewinder, met up against each other right off the bat of the competition and ended with the result of 2-1 to Mindfreak.RAZER. This ended up being the only game Mindfreak.RAZER dropped in Pro Pool Play with them going on to win 20 games with only 1 loss.

**Sunday**

Sunday marked the final day of competition in the pro double elimination tournament. All the pro ranked teams were to match up against all the open teams who progressed from the open double elimination for an epic bracket boasting the best teams in ACL. As the bracket progressed we quickly saw teams such as Mindfreak.RAZER, VoxE, iNFamous, Team Sidewinder, New Era and Break Even all taking out their winners round 1 matches easily with a quick 3-0. However we saw the open double elimination winners Team Chimera give Substance Abuse a real run for their money, narrowly losing the series 2-3, and in the match up of Initial Concept verses Take Aim we actually saw Take Aim upset Initial Concept 3-2.  In the winners bracket round 2 we saw Mindfreak.Razer run past Substance Abuse 3-0, Team Sidewinder take down Take Aim 3-0, iNFamous upset Vox Eminor 3-1 and Break Even beat New Era 3-1. In the winners bracket semi-finals we saw Mindfreak.RAZER once again show their dominance 3-0'ing iNFamous and Team Sidewinder showing why they are a top team knocking Break Even down to the losers bracket after beating them 3-1. This set up the winners bracket final match up between Team Sidewinder and Mindfreak.RAZER, and while many thought Mindfreak would just breeze past TSW like they had been doing all tournament TSW pulled off the biggest upset of the competition taking down Mindfreak and knocking them into the losers bracket.  In the losers bracket we saw Team Chimera fight their way from losers round 1 to be the only open bracket team to place in the top 8, beating Initial Concept 3-2 in placement to place 7th. In losers bracket round 4 we saw Vox Eminor 3-0 Break Even and New Era 3-0 iNFamous, which put them both in the losers bracket semi-finals. New Era seemed to have caught fire by this point in the losers bracket and managed to take out Vox Eminor 3-0.









**Game 2 TS Android from Vibe.**









**Game 3 CTF Element from Vibe's POV.**




It was now down between Mindfreak.RAZER and New Era to see who would meet Team Sidewinder in the finals. Mindfreak.RAZER came out strong taking game 1, although unfortunately it seemed all down hill from their for Mindfreak as New Era took the next two games straight and in the fourth game Royalfan lagged out really sealing the nail in their coffin, meaning New Era progressed to the Finals after taking down Mindfreak.RAZER 3-1.





New Era had a very long road a head of them in the finals. As Team Sidewinder had come into the finals undefeated it meant that New Era had to beat them twice, a feat which they did not seemed intimidated by. The finals were a long and gruelling series, New Era managed to take out the first series 3-2, meaning they had to beat Team Sidewinder again to win the tournament. The finals now turned into a best of 11 series, and the games seemed to go back and forth with each team taking a turn a winning a game. 









**Game 6 of the Finals from Jambun's POV, tying the series 3-3.**




In the 10th game of the finals most of witnessed the most unlucky circumstance we have seen in Halo Reach, the game of Element TS coming down to 49-49 with a trade that went in New Era's favour.









**Game 10, 49-49 all, Heil POV.**





Just like ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 this online tournament came down to the last game, and unfortunately for Team Sidewinder who fought a long and hard series against New Era, New Era managed to pull off the monumental upset coming back to beat TSW 6-5 in the finals and that crowning them then champions of ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 3.
