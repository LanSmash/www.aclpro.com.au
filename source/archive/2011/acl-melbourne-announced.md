**Venue Parking:**

If you are wishing to drop your equipment off at the venue first then park your car then drive up to the control gate, press the intercom and say that you're going to the Union Hall. From there, drive to the hall and carry in your equipment. Cars cannot be left in the drop-off area for more than ten minutes. Drive back out past the control gate again and into car park 3 (as seen on Campus Map above) then walk back to the hall and enter the LAN. Car park 3 is nearest to the hall, otherwise use car parks 1, 2, 2a or 6.






**Food & Drinks:**

There is also a local McDonalds about 15mins walk away from the venue and if you can drive there is also other local fast food restaurants located a bit further away as well. Last year there was a Campus Canteen open inside the Venue that served hot food and drinks but it is unconfirmed at this time if it will be open again this year. We will have ice cold soft drinks available for purchase in the venue and of course you are always free to pack your own lunch.
