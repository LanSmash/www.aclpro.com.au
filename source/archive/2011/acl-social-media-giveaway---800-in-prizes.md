**ACL has over $800 in prizes to giveaway as part of a social media campaign!**




The Australian Cyber League needs more fans, followers and subscribers!! We are gearing up for the biggest year yet in Australian gaming, and we need to recruit more players for the 2012 circuit. To make a bigger name for ourselves, we are offering users prizes to help push the ACL name to our friends, families and greater gaming network.








**HOW IT WORKS**




The quicker we reach our goals, the quicker we give away prizes!! We've got a total of 9 prizes, and 3 different channels to give them away through. We've broken down each channel into 3 stages, or 'unlock levels'. For example, once we reach a certain goal, we'll give away a certain prize specific to that goal. We will give that prize away to a random user who is signed up to that social media channel.





So don't waste any time, make sure you tell everyone you know who's interested in gaming so we can give these fantastic prizes away. Just get them to like our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and Subscribe to our YouTube channel.





The only condition present for the winners are that they must be living in Australia or New Zealand.
