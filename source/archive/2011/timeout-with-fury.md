Hobbies: Gaming, not getting goosed






**ACL: Tell us how long you have all been playing games, and what was the first title or console that got you hooked on gaming?**





**Asikk:**
 I've been playing games since I was so young, starting off with the old Nintendo, been hooked ever since.






**Monk:**
 I've been gaming since I was a kid, but the Xbox 360 and Halo 3 got me hooked onto gaming.






**Cheez:**
 I've been gaming my whole life since Sega Saturn.






**ACL: How did you guys first find out about ACL?**





**Asikk:**
 My brother used to play H2 with some of the old school kids, like Nitros, and I went to a FFA LAN in my area for the release of the 360 and watched some of the best players in Australia play Halo 2 and just started playing Halo hard out since then.






**Monk:**
 I found out about ACL through Shano early 09' which is when I played my first online competition then kept going from there.






**Cheez:**
 Well I've been playing competitive Halo since Halo 2 with Friction and when I started playing Halo 3 I think he met a few guys here and he told me to join.






**ACL: Looking back on ACL Melbourne, Monk and Demon were the only members from your team to attend that event. What did you guys think of the event? And Asikk and Cheez, how come you guys werenâ€™t in attendance?**





**Asikk:**
 Well I didn't have a team and didn't want to go to a LAN without a team.






**Monk:**
 Being my first LAN event. I had so much fun playing on LAN for once and finally meeting people I've been speaking to for years. Saying that Sydney is going to be better, I'm pumped.






**Cheez:**
 I didn't have a team and I guess I'm too young to travel alone. 






**ACL: This Fury lineup formed after ACL Melbourne and in the lead up to ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2. Can you tell us a bit about how this team formed? And what each player on the team brings to the table?**





**Asikk:**
 Well fury has been around for ages, it was called hit list in H3, but we were pretty bad. Cheez and I have been teaming ever since. Demon was pretty new to the Halo scene and we didn't even really consider teaming with him until New Era took him under their wing and he just became such a better player, and we knew he would be a good asset to the team. I have been good friends with Monk for a while and when he split up with Unite we had to snatch him up.






**Monk:**
 Amped/Unite disbanded after Melbourne. I was planning on quitting gaming but I knew Fury didn't have a 4th for R2 so I decided to play with them for R2. I was then planning to quit after R2 but I became good friends with the Fury boys and now playing with them for Sydney. What I bring to the table to the team is that I just do anything that needs to be done, I don't have a set role. But I'm the one that goes over films with them and explains what we are doing wrong and how to improve. 






**Cheez:**
 I've been teaming with Asikk since H3 and after Melbourne there were a few FA's and I think Asikk asked Monk to join and Demon had to beg us to get in and what I bring to the table is making Asikk stop playing objective and learning how to playing MLG.






**ACL: In ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 you guys finished 4th and were the second highest placing Australian team in the tournament. What lead to such a strong performance during this tournament?**





**Asikk:**
 We played pretty horrible on the Saturday due to me having no sleep the night before because I had been clubbing in the city for my mates 18th. On the Sunday however we just got our head in the game and did our best.






**Monk:**
 In pool play we played bad since there were two slayers and one objective game. But in the pro bracket it's the other way around. I guess we just all performed well and got the placing of 4th.






**Cheez:**
In pool play we were just playing really bad and raging at each other but on the Sunday we just played how we are supposed too.






**ACL: Let's talk about the 5 game series between Initial Concept for Top 4. You guys were 2-0 down and came back to win the series 3-2. What was going through your heads during that series? How were you able to turn it around?**





**Asikk:**
 Well, as Tranquility said in his timeout those last 3 gametypes were some on iC's weakest and they just happened to be our strongest, and I guess we just played better on the day.






**Monk:**
 Honestly I didn't even know that we were 2 games down and they only needed to win one more game to knock us out. So that being said my mental game was still focused. Some of our good gametypes at Game 3 and after were all being played so that gave us an advantage. Just after taking that first game making it 2-1 must of gone into their head and we just carried on from there. Their dual-host was insanely bad for me so once we got into game 5 each time they choked or played bad I t-bagged them and beatdown their corpse to get into their head. Haha it seemed to have worked. When we won I actually went mental and ran out the house into the backyard and basically attacked my dog, then ran around the backyard then came back inside after like 5 mins. I was also half naked doing this.






**Cheez:**
 I think we just kept our cool and didn't think what the score was and were good at those gametypes.






**ACL: On to ACL Sydney, I believe you guys are already at the same house in preparation for the event? Is this mainly for some side-by-side practice leading up to the LAN or just a chance for you guys to hang out and have some fun?**





**Asikk:**
 Well me and Pete are at Cheez's house now, its a shame that demon had to leave due to work.. But we still are getting some decent practice in with 3 of us here. The main point for us coming to Cheez's house was to LAN and get some practice, but we ended up getting along really well and are having a heaps mad time together.






**Monk:**
 This is mainly to get some good practice in before the Sydney event. From day 1 Cheez was too focused on looking at his teammates screen way to much, which starting making him play bad. So we already fixed that and now we know he won't have that problem at the event. This is why I wanted to do this, playing on tri/quad-host is also fun haha. We also have been hanging out as well. Cheez only lives minutes away from the beach and I finally went to a 7/11 store for the first time! It was awesome, but I forgot to buy a slurpey...which was the main reason why I wanted to go haha.






**Cheez:**
 A bit of both but its really good for practice and for Monk how to show me how not to get goosed. 






**ACL: Leading up to Melbourne predictions are quite varied, many of many especially concerning how Fury will perform. With such a strong performance in R2, and probably one of the best practiced teams going into the event how do you guys see yourselves placing?**





**Asikk:**
 I'm pretty confident with my team, but I know we have so much more potential, I guess it depends how much we practise and how hard we practise, and how we play on the day but I'm hoping for a decent placing.






**Monk:**
 I've been flicking through the forums lately and some players have been predicting us quite high. I don't know where they are getting these predictions from though. I feel were still not playing as good as we should be yet, so in the next couple of days we're going to game hardcore. But at the same time a lot of people are predicting us below top 6. Just to let people know, we have a confirmed preLAN with bE on Friday. So that's going to be a lot of fun. We'll be sure to post results on ACL for everyone to know.






**Cheez:**
 I think we might get top four but there are some scary teams out there






**ACL: No Remorse has of just recently expressed last minute interest of attending ACL Sydney with the line up of Omen, Fearless, Kself + an unconfirmed 4th. Almost in the same boat is Break Even, widely recognised as the second best Halo 3 team in Australia. Both of these teams are coming into the event with minimal practise, but due to their experience have a lot more teamwork and intelligence about the game than some of our newer and more practiced teams. How do you see these guys placing at ACL Sydney? Do you think their Halo 3 skills and knowledge will carry over to Halo Reach at the event?**





**Asikk:**
 bE will place well I think, and beat most practised teams just because of their previous history together, + with a 19 game series with iM and pre lanning us all day Friday they will have some great practise. Nr should beat most teams.






**Monk:**
 I was excited when they made a thread about nR coming to Sydney. I'm very curious to see how they will perform. I know Kself is a boss and he'll do good at Sydney. I can't remember who but either Omen or Fearless have been gaming with iM a couple of weeks ago. bE just did a 19 game series with iM last night, so at least they finally got some practice in. But I'm going to say bE top 4-5, but I have no idea with nR since they don't have a confirmed 4th yet.






**Cheez:**
 I think we'll beat nR but bE hopefully there'll be some close games, I aint scared .






**ACL: With all the diverse teams coming into ACL Sydney it sure is making it a hard event to predict. However, I am asking for all your top 8 predictions. I want clear predictions, not any of this 4th/5th or 2nd/3rd nonsense, a decisive top 8 please!**





**Asikk:**


1st. iM


2nd. nE


3rd. bE


4th. dE


5th. X&Y


6th. iC


7th. nR maybe?


8th. Distinctive

**ACL: Of course not only will there be a Reach 4v4 tournament but a Reach FFA tournament as well. After ACL Melbourne Monk has already established himself as a top FFA player but how do you think the rest of you guys will go? Is FFA your game? And can we expect another Top 8 finish Monk?**





**Asikk:**
 Yea I'll do bad, no snipe for me to stat with in the FFA






**Monk:**
 Haha, I'm bad a FFA's. I don't really even like them. There are a lot more players coming into this event and a lot of them are high skilled so this FFA is going to have much different placings this time around. I see myself in top 8 hopefully but I want to see how Brad from bE performs in this FFA... and my Hopey of course.






**Cheez:**
 I don't know probably top 8?






**ACL: Alright thanks for your time guys, hit us with some shout outs!**
