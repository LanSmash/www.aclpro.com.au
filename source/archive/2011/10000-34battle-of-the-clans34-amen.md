Amendments

For those that missed the amendments post in the original announcement, there were a few concerns and questions raised about this LAN. GAME has listened and made some changes to the initial "Terms and Conditions" to open the competition up to more teams and players.



**The following was added and changed:**





- Any player can compete as long as they are 18+ and not in a 
**WRITTEN**
 contract binding them to a team, organisation,  company, sponsor etc.


- Teams are able to substitute 
**ONE**
 player from the qualifying rounds out for the Grand Final. To see the full terms and conditions and ammendements

Entries

Currently there is a lack of CG/ACL teams entering, so please, enter your team
**NOW**
 in either a 50 word entry or video entry. A video entry is NOT compulsory!






QuoteTaken from 
[The GAME website.](http://www.game.com.au/battleoftheclans)**There are 2 ways to enter for Battle of the Clans**
 - either through a written response or with a video entry. If you enter with a video entry and are selected, you'll also receive a bonus exclusive prize pack at the tournament showdown.






**To enter with a written entry:**
 Simply tell us in 50 words or less why you and your clan should be selected to compete to become the official clan of GAME and Turtle Beach. Submit your entry to clans@game.com.au






**To enter with a video entry:**
 Simply gather up your clan and make a short video (2 minutes or less) convincing us why you should qualify for the chance to become the official clan of GAME and Turtle Beach. Just make sure you mention GAME somewhere in your video entry. For example, you could put a GAME logo in your video, or say, 'Game On'. Then, upload your video entry and send it as a downloadable link eg. Megaupload etc. (No Youtube submissions will be accepted)





**If a solid, highly respected team has an exceptional entry, they will most likely know of their acceptance earlier than the close date in order to make travel arrangements.**








Spectators

Because this is strictly an invite only event, those that want to win an invite must follow GAME's Facebook at 
[http://www.facebook.com/GAMEAus](http://www.facebook.com/GAMEAus) and look out for more information. Spectator passes are extremely limited so make sure you troll the page as much as you troll your favourite forums









What do I need and where is the event?

The event will be played on Saturday 27th August in Sydney with
**FREE ENTRY and CONSOLES & SCREENS**
 supplied for you to play. All you need to do is rock up with your controller & headset to get your game on!









Scrims and Practice!

To assist teams looking to compete in this event, ACL is hosting a fun scrim/practice night in order for teams to prepare for the LAN festives. Friday 26th has been confirmed with another date and more information TBA soon.









Looking for a team or members?
