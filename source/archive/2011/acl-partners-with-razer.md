At ACL Melbourne last weekend, The Australian Cyber League (ACL) announced a partnership with competitive gaming powerhouse Razer which will see the Razer Onza Tournament Edition be named as the official controller of the ACLPro Circuit for 2011.





The Razer Onza Tournament Edition has been designed specifically for competitive console gaming, providing the highest level of precision, accuracy and comfort available for gamers.





The controller features dials on the front which allows users to individually fine tune the tension on each of the joysticks. Other features include a completely revamped D-pad, improved triggers, hyper-action buttons, and the ability to re-map all of the buttons.





Director of ACL, Nick Vanzetti, said the news of this partnership is further proof of ACL making great leaps in the Australian competitive gaming scene.





“Razer is the undisputed leader in competitive PC gaming. With them making the move into the console scene, we’re so excited to be able to partner together,” he said.





“Our competitors love gaining the edge over their opponents through state-of-the-art headphones and monitors. Controllers are the next, and arguably most important step in gaining that competitive edge. Through choosing Razer controllers we’re enabling our competitors to perform at their peak.”





Attendees had the chance to get their hands on the controller through various demo stations situated around the tournament over the course of the weekend.
