The first day of Halo: Reach competition has come and gone here at ACL Sydney with several upsets already taking place in the early stages of pool-play.





With Voltage taking out the FFA tournament early in the day, all attention turned to the main event, the 4v4. Whilst many were expecting team such as Team Immunity and New Era to finish on top, many questions still surrounded the middle-tier teams.





The initial shock came in the very first round of pool play, when Initial Concept (Jim, Tranquility, Stryfe and Jayce) knocked off New Era (Vibe, Fade, Blaze, Natural Talent) with a score of 2-1. After play had finished in that pool, New Era and Initial Concept would both finish with a 77% win success rate.





Another interesting result came in Pool B, with 8 Max (Nuguns, King Arrow, Satiex and Bramble) knocking over KGo (Blocks, Msl, Deci, S5 Unit) with a 3-0 sweep, quite a surprise to many considering that several members in the 8 Max squad have voiced several times that they rarely, if ever play Halo: Reach.





In Pool C, the much-favoured Death Eaters (Hopey, Chantelle, Dark and Karloo) cruised through without dropping a game, whereas former ACL Pro Halo 3 player Adz wasn’t experiencing the same luck, as his crew of Super Best Friends (Strider, Petephile, Parkerino and Adz) only managed to win two games throughout all of pool play.





Pool D saw some heavy competition in the likes of X&Y (Toddles, RoyalFan, Pulse and Blood Weapon) and No Remorse (Omen, Fearless, Killself and Godlike). No Remorse, a team consisting of several past players with very little experience, have performed very well, notching up a 77% win ratio. On an interesting note, when the two teams met each other, No Remorse came away with the chocolates, coming out 2-1 victors.





No surprises were to be had in Pool E, with Team Fury (Monk, Demon, Asikk and Cheez) coming out without dropping a game, receiving very few challenges from any of the others teams in their pool. The biggest surprise was held for the end of pool play, when Team Immunity and Team Fury were to face off against each other to determine who would take the first seed heading into Double Elimination.





In a one-off game of Element Team Slayer, Team Immunity kicked off to a quick lead, and looked to secure their much expected first seed. However, in a late-game charge, Team Fury came from behind to take the match 50-47, along with the first-seed. 





Following pool play the placing would read as follows:





1.	Team Fury


2.	Team Immunity


3.	Death Eaters


4.	New Era


5.	Initial Concept


6.	No Remorse


7.	X&Y


8.	Distinctive


9.	Break Even


10.	Infamous





With pool play only in its infancy, it will be interesting to see if Team Fury’s first seed was simply a fluke, or if they can back it up with a solid performance throughout Double Elimination. With MLG Anaheim looming in the distance, will Team Immunity be able to prove that they are still the best team in Australia? And what about all of the middle-tier teams mentioned earlier?





ACL Sydney has been the most unpredictable event so far and there’s sure to be even more surprises in store tomorrow. Make sure you tune in to www.aclpro.com.au to see which team is crowned ACL
