Wow... What a year! That is what most of us are saying after the end of the 2011 ACL National Circuit, and what a year it has been! It’s hard to believe it’s already time for us to wrap everything up on what has surely been ACL’s most successful year to date. It has been a year of monumental growth in our community, with attendance levels and stream numbers rising with every event. All of ACL’s supported titles, Halo Reach, Call of Duty Black Ops and FIFA 11, along with “the fighters” Super Street Fighter IV, Marvel v Capcom 3 and Super Smash Brother Brawl & Melee, all had exciting and close competition for the year.






Although small in numbers, the most passionate players by far were to be found in FIFA11.

**Melbourne**

Marking the season opener and FIFA’s first appearance as an official ACL title, Melbourne was a fierce competition for those gunning to secure a top spot on ACL’s FIFA ladder. With Online Round 1 champion Muzza a no show due to competing in the Fifa Interactive World Cup, punters looked towards the likes of Brett, Cripsy and Todd to contest for the number one. Pool play ended as expected with Brett sweeping his pool and Cripsy coming out on top as well. The bracket, however, was another story.





Brett tore through Darkspawn and Brandz on the way to the Winners Bracket Final, while dark horse Somedude overcame favorite Todd in an exciting 3 game series before beating Cripsy to face Brett. Brett defeated Somedude and lay waiting for his next opponent in the Championship Match. The Loser’s bracket is where the story starts though as Cripsy defeated Trazza in Losers Bracket Round 2 and then dominated Todd, setting up a rematch against Somedude.





Cripsy made no mistake this time around, Somedude was put to the sword in two games without notably threatening Cripsy’s defense. The fairytale run had reached the final and did not fail to impress. Cripsy took out game 1 in a close fashion before Brett replied by shutting out game 2. It all came down to game 3. Cripsy was reduced to ten men late in normal time with the scores at 2-2 before smashing home a winner against the play in extra time.





A great run through the Loser’s bracket marked this tournament a huge one for Cripsy and if the smack talk between Cripsy and Brett was any indicator, it also marked the start of a rivalry for the rest of the 2011 season.

**Sydney**

Sydney was the biggest tournament for FIFA on the 2011 circuit, gamers from all over dropping in to compete for the top place. It would be Muzza’s first event after missing Melbourne but taking out Online Round 2 left him in good stead. Mark "Skip 1" Azzi was also to make an appearance hot off placing 3rd in the Fifa Interactive World Cup. These two, combined with the ACL regulars shrouded the number 1 spot with mystery.





Muzza made a statement in pool play by destroying Cripsy on mainstage and Skip made a similar impression in his pool. Newcomer Humpty shocked some more experienced players by topping his pool in an impressive fashion. These three as well as Cripsy continued to impress in bracket play. Muzza took out King and Brett before ousting Cripsy to reach the Winners Bracket Final and Skip defeated Trazza and Bman before ending Humpty’s hot streak.





The WBF was a true clash of the titans as both Muzza and Skip were uncontested so far in the competition. A 2-0 series win by Skip gave the fixture little justice as Muzza was closely ousted in both games to drop into the Loser’s Bracket. Humpty didn’t let his defeat in the Winner’s bracket curb his impressive countering style as he took out Brett and Cripsy on his way to the Losers Bracket Final. Muzza took out the first game 1-0 before Humpty replied impressively by running circles around Muzza’s defense. Muzza rallied in game 3 to take out the series and set up a much anticipated rematch against Skip.

**Skip and Muzza playing out the Winners Bracket Final at ACL Sydney**




The final started slowly with each competitor taking a game, the decider really opened up in the 85th minute when Skip took the lead. Showing a lot of character, Muzza scored possibly the goal of the season considering the circumstances when he completed a triangle play featuring a back heel to equalize in the 90th minute. The match went into extra time where Muzza went ahead on the 105th minute before Skip equalised minutes later. That wasn't the end though as Muzza rallied once again and scored in the dying moments of the game to close out Skip and the Sydney competition.






**Brisbane**

The finals event was one that featured possibly the strongest lineup of players, the guard from Sydney minus Cripsy and Humpty was attending with the addition of Maverick, Spurs and Peteh. Skip was back to get revenge on Muzza who had recently won Online Round 3 and was looking to complete his perfect tournament record.





Skip impressed in pool play to take out top seed, but Muzza fell early to Peteh before rallying for third seed. Spurs silenced the haters by coming out of pool play with the fourth seed. In double elimination, Skip took out Maverick and Todd as expected to reach the Winners Bracket Final, on the other side of the bracket Brett took down Muzza before being defeated by Lakey who was on fire with Real Madrid.





Skip snuffed out Lakey’s run in the Winner’s bracket with ease to advance to the Championship match, Lakey was left to wait for the Loser’s bracket to play out for his next match. As a trend, Muzza demolished the Loser’s bracket, wiping the floor with Peteh in vengeance before taking down Todd and Brett on his way to Lakey. Lakey’s first appearance in the finals at a LAN event was marred by the fury that was Muzza, conceding 10 goals in two games on his way to third place.





The master class met yet again in the final, a rematch of the Sydney finals and LBR2 in Online R3 was on the cards for the 2011 National Championship. Muzza never slowed down from his Losers Bracket run and took out the first game 1-0 with a fine Ronaldo header. Inspired by the first win, Muzza never looked back and took out Skip impressively in the second game to become ACL’s first FIFA National Champion, winning every ACL tournament he played in 2011.






**Skip and Muzza playing Game 2 in the Championship Match**




After winning ACL Online Rounds 1, 2 and 3 as well as ACL Sydney, the Brisbane Finals was the jewel on Muzza's crown of success in 2011. On several occasions showing strong character to dig through the Losers Bracket, the mark of a true National Champion.

A rising force in the world of ACL, Call of Duty's season was full of excitement and surprises.

**Melbourne**

With Melbourne being the first stop for the 2011 circuit and with the brand spanking new Black Ops on the market, teams were eager to make their mark in ACL Call of Duty history, all rearing to take out the first event of the season. With new teams in the mix such as Cruelty Incarnate, a resident GameBattle's team turned LAN team after impressive online performances as well as the ACL regulars such as Frenetic Array and Malice. Ego's were flaring and the trash talk was starting as teams boasted about their recent placings in ACL Online Round 1 as well as previous titles such as the 2010 National Champs. With pride on the line and the hype to see how the newer teams fared, the stage was set for Melbourne to kick the LAN circuit off with a bang!





Despite losing to the 2010 national champs (Frenetic Array) in the early stages of the event, the newly formed Cruelty Incarnate took center stage as they showed their might coming back from previous defeat to take out the champs in the Grand Final. It was a truly inspiring comeback showing that even when your down, teamwork and communication can get you over the line. Oh and having a decent shot doesn't go astray either!





While they weren't always in the spotlight, teams such as Five Down, Emperor and Taunted also made a name for themselves showcasing the up and coming talent the 2011 season had to offer. They didn't disappoint either, placing a respectable 3rd to 5th respectively, with some great showings of spawn traps and g33k nades all round. 





Cruelty Incarnate's Naked showed his talent being named MVP of the event with a graceful display of Mp5K skills and unique rush style of gameplay unknown to many of the 4's teams at the time. But what is a player without his team? Helping to bring home the victory were his teammates Insanity, StenGunz & team captain Vilesyder.

After knocking off the heavy favorites to win (Frenetic Array), Cruelty Incarnate were looking like strong contenders ready to take on the rest of the 2011 season and why wouldn't they? A team formed days before the event had just knocked off the 2010 national champions!!






**Sydney**

Ahh Sydney, Melbourne's team pool has just been put to shame. Although less teams turned up to Sydney, the ones that did come were regarded as the best of the best for Black Ops competitive 4's. With teams returning such as Frenetic Array, Cruelty Incarnate, Emperor and Taunted the tournament looked hard enough to win. Then MindFreak decided to gate crash the party. Being one of the best 5v5 Search & Destroy teams around and one of the most respected teams in the league, Sydney was looking to be massive.





With blood in the water after multiple team changes and shock departures by a few players, the hype surrounding Sydney could only grow. None more so than the online feud between the new Frenetic Array lineup and the boys from MindFreak. Both teams able to take a game of the other at a moments notice and both hungry for victory after all the t-talk and ego explosions on the forums prior to ACL Sydney.





Fresh off their win in Black Ops Online Round 2, Frenetic Array were looking sharp with their new lineup consisting of their captain Buzzin, Geemon, Renzy & Trent. The boys looked in great form not dropping a series in pool play seeding them first for the double elimination to come. Hot on their trail was their rivals MindFreak placing second in hot pursuit not allowing Fray to run off with the title of ACL Sydney champs.





After some grueling double elimination, the stage was set with fan favorites Frenetic Array facing off against their arch nemesis MindFreak. It was a real life clash of the titans about to go down on the main stage. After a thrilling series MindFreak eventually managed to sneak in a lead and pushed on full steam ahead guaranteeing the win and sealing Frenetic Arrays fate. All was not lost for the Fray boys as the National's were just around the corner in the form of ACL Brisbane.

**2011 ACL Sydney Champions: Mindfreak.Razor - Rapture, Zeeq, Naked, Kritikal**





**Brisbane**


After what has been an up and down years for Call of Duty teams abroad, the finals were here and the best of the best had flown in from all corners of Australia chasing the title of the 2011 Call of Duty Black Ops National Champions. With attendance picking up from Sydney's event, Brisbane was set to be the toughest competition to date with big hitters MindFreak and Frenetic Array returning to bring the pain.





Picking up where they left off at Sydney, Frenetic Array returned with its all-star lineup and the addition of their core 4th member StenGunz back into the team gave them the confidence boost they needed to bounce back from their defeat at ACL Sydney. Not deterred by their loss in ACL Black Ops Online Round 3 to the hands of Taunted, this re-vamped lineup had their game faces on from the word go.





After breezing through pool play only really having one close encounter to a freshly pruned Cruelty Incarnate, Frenetic Array secured their first place seeding for the double elimination. Coming in close contention was MindFreak taking the second seed and Cruelty Incarnate following closely in third. Meanwhile the recent winners of Online Round 3 found themselves having difficulty without their star player.





Moving through the double elimination, Frenetic Array went undefeated into the Grand Final cementing their shot at the national championship. After being knocked into the losers bracket by Cruelty Incarnate, MindFreak were slowly working their way back up the ranks to once again face off in another epic finale. Unfortunately for the boys they were knocked out and send home with a third place finish overall after running into the dark horses known as Cruelty Incarnate. The series was arguably the best out of all the events with both teams conjuring up amazing comebacks to take games off each other with Cruelty managing to seal the deal.





Finally the time had come for the energizer bunnies Cruelty Incarnate to take on the aimbots that were Frenetic Array in a continuation series of their previous match-up with Fray heading into the series with a 3-2 lead. In the end after 10/11 games played in the series, the scores were as follows 6-3-1 (Win-Loss-Tie) to Fray and 3-6-1 for Cruelty who put up one hell of a fight against the unstoppable force that has become, Frenetic Array.

Two previous runner-up placings from Frenetic Array led to relief as much as celebration when they finally took out ACL's National Championship and their first LAN victory in 2011. Very impressive for a team who's ex-fourth came back from a lengthy hiatus two days before the tournament.

Last but not least, Halo Reach's competition did not disappoint and kept you excited throughout the entire year.

**Melbourne**

Melbourne was the first stop of ACL’s 2011 circuit and the first official LAN debut of the Halo Reach 4v4 competition. With a new game came new challengers and 15 of the finest teams in Australia came to duke it out to win ACL’s first ever Halo Reach 4v4 LAN event. The teams were, as a whole, a bit of a mix and match of seasoned veterans and new up-and-comers.  Reigning 2010 champions and MLG attendees Team Immunity were also back to show their dominance in the latest Halo title and they did not disappoint.





Without dropping a single game in the double elimination bracket, Team Immunity went on to win the competition with a 6-0 victory over the then-named Frenetic Array. However, this second place finish for Fray and their line up of Hopey, Haunted, Monk and Dark would only be the start of a very successful year for these players.





The rest of the competition was by no means overshadowed, with the likes of New Era, X&Y, Outbreak, Sworn Oath, Initial Concept and Original Gangsters all placing 3rd-8th respectively in what was a hard-fought and exciting competition. Substance Abuse would place 9th, a consistent placing that would stick through the rest of the year. 





Team Immunity’s Benno was once again the FFA Champ, however, it wasn’t a title that would stick with him for long in 2011. Highlights of the event would have to be X&Y’s win over Sworn Oath in the Winners Bracket Quarter-Final and Fray’s 3-0 win over New Era in the Losers Bracket Finals. This competition would be the  spark for a huge season of Halo that lay ahead.






**Sydney**

Fury. It was a team that no one had heard of until they snatched the #1 seed out from under Team Immunity’s nose. A shock to everyone, Fury dominated in their pool play match ups, however, their magical run wouldn’t last once they hit the double elimination bracket. There they met the best of the 20 teams that attended ACL Sydney. Teams like X&Y, Break Even and New Era, names that are synonymous with top-level competitive Halo were in the mix.





Once double-elimination started, it was déjà vu as Immunity fought their way to another victory in the ACL circuit, making it 2/2 for the year so far. However, no excitement was to be found in the winner, rather the place-getters. Distinctive, now known as Vox Eminor shocked many to beat long-standing Halo team Break Even for the 2nd spot. New Era, Initial Concept, Death Eaters, Fury and X&Y would then follow 4th-8th respectively. The most exciting series of Sydney, by far, was that of Distinctive vs Fury in the Winners Bracket Quarter Final. With Fury 2-0 up in the series, Distinctive came back with a landslide 3-2 victory – this series is my pick for series of the year.

**ACL Sydney Runners-up: Team Distinctive - Haze, Mantis, Halvo, Crux**




As for the FFA, long-standing 9 event champion Benno was knocked off his perch by none other than his own teammate Voltage in a thrilling FFA final that saw Pulse get a surprising 2nd place with Benno following in 3rd. 






**Brisbane**

After the thrilling competition that was seen at ACL’s Melbourne and Sydney events, everyone was excited to see what competition lay ahead at ACL’s Brisbane Finals event. With a near record breaking attendance of 21 teams the ACL Finals event would definitely not disappoint.





Coming into the finals there were some major players going in to make a name for themselves and contend for the top spot. As expected, Team Immunity were back to try and claim their 3rd consecutive championship but not without the newly sponsored Mindfreak Razer, Vox Eminor and Break Even squads trying to stop them. Big names with well practiced players were in with a fighting chance and the competition that unfolded was fierce.





Hopey led his team Mindfreak Razer to an impressive second place finish, cementing their place as one of the top Halo Reach teams. This was no small feat, beating Break Even in the Losers Bracket Final. The throw-together team of Deano, Shockz, Lunar and Mitchy would see BOSS clinch the 4th spot away from VoxE, New Era and Infamous.





The most impressive team, however, would be none other than the 2011 Halo Reach champions, Team Immunity. Their line up with new 4th Ogre1, played all the way through and won the competition without dropping a single game, a feat that had never before been achieved at an ACL event. Team Immunity, Australia’s own “God-Squad”, proved why they were #1.






**Team Immunity. The undisputed champions of Australian Halo.**
