FIFA 11 has provided one of the most exciting and controversial series that we’ve ever seen on the ACL Pro Circuit.





After emerging from pool play as the top two players, Muzza and Skip would ultimately meet in the Grand Final to play in a best of 3 series.


With both players taking a game each, it would head to a final and decisive third came to decide the winner of ACL Sydney.





With both players stuck at nil all heading into the final stages, it was Skip who would strike first  in roughly the 84th minute to take a 1-0 lead with only roughly a minute to go. Muzza, not to be outdone, would reply almost instantaneously, with a clever flick pass into the centre of the box, which he capitalised on to tie the scores at 1-1 in the 89th minute.





With all scores tied up, the players would head into extra time to determine the winner. After a slow start to begin with, Muzza managed a clever cross into the waiting head of Drogba, who slotted it into the back of the net. Usually this would result in play continuing for the remainder of extra time, however the two players had accidentally selected for a winner to be determined via ‘Golden Goal’, and the game ended.





After much deliberation, it was decided that a replay would occur with neither player making a move until the 25th minute mark. At that point, Skip would concede an own goal, and play would commence for the remainder of the half. This was chosen because FIFA 11 works with a very complex “Momentum Engine” which makes the players play better when they’re confidence is high.





Skip, however, proved momentum was no factor in the game, answering back almost immediately to keep his chances of victory still alive.





With only about 30 seconds remaining in this makeshift second half of over time, Muzza proved he was difficult to rattle, and a clever cross followed up by a brilliant strike would put the ball in the back of the net, leaving Skip without any time to mount another serious offence. Thus, Muzza was declared the winner of ACL Sydney for FIFA 11.





Speaking to Hooters and Brett after the game, Muzza noted that the pressure and intensity of the final series was unlike anything he’d ever experienced before. After experiencing a lot of success in our online FIFA rounds, he noted that he’d most definitely caught the LAN bug, and that we’d be seeing him at ACL Brisbane later on this year.





A huge amount of credit must also be given to Skip. For those unaware, his platform of choice for FIFA 11 is the PlayStation 3, which is of a faster pace compared to the Xbox 360 version. His ability to transfer to a new platform and still make it to the finals is a testament to his natural talent at the game.


FIFA is proving time and time again that it is one of the most exciting games on the circuit, and ACL Sydney was no exception. Be sure to look out for more FIFA 11 action through both our ACL FIFA Online Rounds, as well as our at our final event for 2011, ACL Brisbane in October.
