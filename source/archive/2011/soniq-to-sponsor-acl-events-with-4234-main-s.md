****Soniq enters partnership with ACL to supply audience displays for the ACL main-stage.****





**The Australian Cyber League (ACL) today announced a partnership with consumer electronics manufacturer Soniq which will see the ACL main-stage decked out with two Full HD LCD screens to showcase all of the action taking place on the premiere stage for Australian competitive gaming.**




The Soniq L42S10A features a cutting edge 42” LCD screen, coupled with a modern design to suit any living room. Whilst containing a high quality Panasonic panel, the L42S10A is still highly affordable, retailing for $599. With resolutions up to 1080p supported, and a built in HD tuner, images appear crystal clear in Full HD.





The display also features USB 2.0 high speed media such as movies, photos and music, allowing you to simply plug in any USB device and stream your digital content straight to the screen.





Director of ACL, Nick Vanzetti, said the news of this partnership is a great way to keep event participants glued to the action of the main-stage.





“ACL events are just as much about competing as they are about spectating. Through this partnership with Soniq, we’re bringing all of the great action to our live audiences in crystal clear format,” he said.





“Through the addition of main stage LCD screens, we’re now able to showcase more action simultaneously than ever before.”





Over the course of the weekend, the Soniq displays will broadcast all of the best action from Halo: Reach, Call of Duty: Black Ops, FIFA 11 Super Street Fighter IV, and Marvel vs Capcom 3.
