**ACL: Tell us how long you have all been gaming, and what was the first game that got you hooked into gaming?**






**Roylanfan:** I've played halo since h1 with my dad and brother, but very, very casually and I was a total noob. My brother had to always force me to play with him but when I moved to australia at the end of '07 I started playing halo3 alot more since there was absolutely nothing else to do in our small cramped apartment. My brother found out about MLG and the first event I watched was Meadowlands '08 with FB taking it out. I found out about Neighbor and developed a tiny little crush which eventually bloomed into me searching the mlg playlist every night (i was a 20ish rank) hoping I could matched up with him. Found about ACL late 08' and met Ian(Blainz) and Transitiion(Taylor) who helped me get into it.






**Blainz:** I've been gaming since I was three when my dad first bought the NES with super mario. Since then I'd always been hooked, playing stuff like goldeneye or mario kart with mates but it wasnt till I got an Xbox and Halo CE that I started to get really into gaming. When I found ACL towards the end of halo 2 and start of Halo 3... Thats when shit got real! Hahah.






**Karloo:** Ive gamed on PC since i owned one, but Doofus and some school mates got me hooked into console halo 3 just under two years ago.






**Toddles:**
 I have been gaming since the days of the sega but the first game that really got me hooked would have to be halo 2 with xbox live to play multiplayer. I would spend hours playing online when my brother wasnt dowloading and screwing with my internet.






**ACL: How did you guys first find your way into ACL?**






**Karloo:**
 Simple answer: Doofus haha.






**Royalfan:** I met this guy k0n5tantine (LOL i'm sure people can remember him) who I used to play with heaps...hahahah anyway he introduced me to ACL and I managed to make an account and make an introduction thread after much nervousness. As I said people like Ian and Taylor helped me out and also v J i m v who I remember always invited me to loads of customs. 






**Toddles:**I played a lot of MLG matchmaking (thinking i was top shit at level 45) and played with a friend of a friend (silverblade) who led to frantic who told me about the site, showing me that there were a heap of better players out there.






**Blainz:** Transition and I used to play heaps of halo together and we couldn't find anyone that we knew who was better than us. We had searched for other people and communities but couldn't find any. One day we ran into the Teddies from Nuke and Pave in social slayer and then joined a few of their customs. It wasnt until then I realised just how terrible I was. I heard about ACL from them and Doofus who happened to be in the game and signed up straight away haha.






**ACL: X&Y is a relatively new team, but most of you have been around for a while. How come Karloo and Blainz were the only members from your current team to participate in ACL Reach Online Round 1?**






**Royalfan:**
 Well my extremely legit excuse was that I was overseas for the whole of december, I would have loved to play! 






**Toddles:** I had recently left/been dropped from IC due to constant disagreements with Tranquility and didn't really have a team. I got a few offers from other teams but was also unable to play on the saturday due to family commitments which i couldnt get out.






**Karloo:** I didn't know any of these guys with the h3/reach transition - I met some acl newbies like myself in reach's first month and got practising for R1.






**Blainz:** Yeah I was on Fury with Asikk Cheez and Willgirzim. We placed 5th/6th (never played placement rounds with TSW) which was decent considering I was hating Reach and had hardly played it until the MLG rules came out.






**ACL:** What did you think about the results of ACL Reach Online Round 1? Obviously it was a while ago now, and there have been a lot of team changes, but do you think the results mirrored the skills of teams back then? Were there any teams that particularly impressed or surprised you?






**Blainz:** Well when I was on Fury I think a lot of people were suprised to see that we did as well as we did and I think we could've gone a lot further but there were constant issues with people, including myself not able to get on to practice after a few arguments decided to break up. Also round 1 people were still getting used to the game and players have improved a lot since then, not to mention the drop in players since the start of Halo Reach. Alot of the players have come back now though and theres a lot more competion which is good.



**Karloo:** Ne's win was obviously suprising but those boys were well practised for R1. 






**Toddles:**The top 3 teams didnt surprise me with there placings though I was surprised with my old team IC finishing 7th when we were taking games of Malice (3rd) and having very close series.






**Royalfan:** I wasn't really following too well...I was surprised to hear Fury placed so well though. Didn't really know anything about the other teams except BBR.






**ACL:** Lets talk about X&Y now. You guys have been together for a a while now and have been gaming hard. X&Y have definitely established themselves as a Top 8 team online, maybe even pushing as high as top 4. How do you think you guys compare to the rest of ACL's top teams? Do you think you guys can hang with the best of the best?






**Karloo:** Top 4 sounds good.






**Toddles:**At the moment the only teams I feel that are better than us are Infuse and Fray, all the rest are either on par or not as good in my opinion. With my current job and uni we struggle to get in as much practice as we would like but by the time of Sydney we will be hoping to push Fray.






**Royalfan:** Yeah the core of our team minus Blainz now has been together since Janurary so thats definitely helped. If by top teams you mean fray and Infused, definitely not yet but with anyone else I'd say its fair game. We haven't won a game against fray yet but its good to play them and we've definitely been improving ever since picking up Blainz so hopefully we will be able to contest them soon. I'm not too fussed with the constant team changes I feel as long as we keep the core of our team together that will benefit us more than anything. I'm already so used to playing with Karl and Todd and their playstyles.






**Blainz:** I think we're becoming more solid as a team every time we practice but theres still a lot to improve on. I definitely think its possible for X&Y to take a top placing. We just need to keep working on our faults and im sure itll pay off.






**Karloo:** i would like to type the same 100 words as Shaki but then you would have two identical answer for the timeout..im agreeing completely with the team.






**ACL:** Why do you think you guys have found more a more dominant in Reach than Halo 3? Do you think this team has the dominance to consistently sustain top 8 placements?






**Karloo:** I was never a sucess in h3 but im doing alot better in reach as every player has to go back to square one. Yep we can uphold a top 8 placement.






**Royalfan:** The 2 things I felt let me down in H3 was my lack of individual skill and a long lasting team.Even though I placed 5th at Melb last year,we pretty much broke up straight after. My shitty internet connection for the first half of '10 was also a factor in me not getting picked up by teams. My communication and attitude to the game still remain the same but in Reach I'm way more confident in my DMR and pulling off clutch plays. Also I think I work best in a team and having a solid team to play with, unlike h3, makes me way better than I usually am. 






**Toddles:** I feel like its a complete new game with maps and gametypes etc that it has just leveled the playing feild for most teams. As to sustaining a top 8 placement it think i will be relatively easy as long as we stay together as team.






**Blainz:** Well I teamed with OHHD and that was my first proper team. I loved hanging out and teaming with them and even after I'd told them id stick with them, after some terrible placings eventually we all go sick of it and decided to break up. I think I definitely had the potential to place much higher. I had a team with Friction Royal and Spence shortly after Sydney which is probably one of the most strongest teams ive been on. We put up some really close games with Top Teams after the Sydney LAN last year but after a few issues with Spence and him refusing to take on board our advice he decided to tell me he was sick of me dick riding royal fan for agreeing with her and quit. From there it pretty much fell apart. Im definitely a better player at Halo 3 but with Reach I think we have a lot more teamwork going on.






**ACL:** Lets talk more about your roles and abilities on X&Y. For a team to have success in Halo there is no doubt than any player must be able to fill in position at any time, but what do you think each member of X&Y brings to the team?






**Royalfan:** I just about love Todd's communication, he plays on a really similar level to me so we naturally work well together. I've teamed with Blainz alot on LAN and online so I knew I was going to comfortable playing with him, he has always had sick individual awareness but ever since joining X&Y he has developed into a much stronger team player. He also has some of the clutchest flag runs ever! Karl's a relatively new player but there's no one thats tried harder to improve on this team than him. Sometimes we put alot of pressure on him but from Janurary till now, his improvement has been huge. He has a sick snipe(which he doesn't get enough of I admit) and his communication is great. One of the reasons I wanted to pick him up instead of someone with more experience is his attitude he's a pretty chill guy and takes onboard all the advice we give him and actually tries to work on it.






**Blainz:** Todd is a very solid allround player. He's quite a dominant slayer but still a very team oriented player. Hes good at positioning himself for the team and communicating what needs to be done. Sharki has improved soo much since halo 3 its insane. Her individual skill has improved a tonne but she still has the teamwork and communication she relied on more so in halo 3. Karl is a very valuble player because of his empahsis on teamwork and his ability to go clutch quite often when needed. Its good to have seen him imprve so much in such a short period of time being quite a relativly new player






**Karloo:** Ty kind sir.






**Toddles:** Royalfan has unbelievable  communication and with her individual skill it makes her a really easy player to work with and you always know you have someone watching your back. Karl is the best objective play i know in Aus... but seriously he is always thinking and positioning himself well for when we pull flags and all. Blainz has filled Jayces role really well and is improving with our team and is much better than when he first joined us in all ways. I can now rely on Blainz in almost any situation wether it is supporting me or pulling objective at the right time.






**Karloo:** Royalfan is a very team centred/focused and agressive player. Todd tends to slay and pick up assists being in the right place at the right time. Blainz and me mesh nicely pushing and helping each other out nicely great to play with an encouraging team.






**ACL:** X&Y have been a busy team lately, and I have seen you guys getting in a lot of scrims and practice. One of the most interesting scrim results to note would be your games against iC as they seem to be close games, and most would say you and iC are very similar in skill level and experience. How have your scrims been going with them lately? And which team do you think has the edge, X&Y or iC?






**Karloo:** Each scrim is different as every player is in a different mood/state of mind. I'm often very tired one evening and then prepared and ready to play the next afternoon. Yes they are very capable of taking slayer games off us but we have been setting up much more effectively with objective gametypes.






**Royalfan:** What iC has over us...and its a big thing...is waaaaaaaay more practice time than we get. We lost pretty much every game to them a couple of weeks ago,  but just beat them 5-3 last week with the games we lost being really close. Its just scrims, but I honestly think we are stepping it up and if we continue that we will beat iC. If we get matched up with them this better be on main stage though cause its going to be intense! Stryfe is also a sick player on LAN so i'm definitely watching out for him.






**Blainz:** I think we've come a long way in the last two weeks since we've been getting some solid practice in and while we were struggling before I think we've all become more comfortable with our roles in the team. I know I definitely have and I think we'll have the edge over iC.  






**Toddles:** The first set of scrims against them a couple of weeks ago the only way i could put it is we got raped. After those games it made us have to sit down and look at what we were doing wrong. After looking through all of this i have found it has made us a stronger team and our most recent scrim results would show this. It is all online though i do find that IC isnt all with it when it comes to objective and working as a team and we possibly have the edge over them but anything could happen at Melbourne.






**ACL:** While we are talking about other teams lets touch on ACL's widely conceived top 3 teams; Infused, Fray and New Era. Infused with all their success, experience and practice from Halo 3, Fray with all their new found talent and practice, and New Era with their Round 1 win and dominant players. What do you think puts these teams above the rest? And do you see any Teams (such as Fray or New Era) catching the Infused dynasty any time soon?






**Royalfan:** Practice - I see these guys on all the time, whether it be 3 or 4members of their team scrimming or searching matchmaking. It helps so much, and with Todd and Karl's work + me having to jugggle all my school work and studying with halo its hard. Those teams also have players with insane individual skill but again that also comes from how long they spend playing. 






**Blainz:** I think Infused has the advantage of being together so long and having so much experience playing with each other and getting used to the way they all play. Its possible for New Era and Fray to catch them I just dont think it will happen before ACL Melbourne. Team just need to stick together and have regular practice.






**Karloo:** Infuse's time spent as a team gives them an obivous advantage not forgetting how amazing they are individually. Fray are close, up against infused but do not have the team experience on the clock. 






**Royalfan:** Also though, Infused  have been together for ages unlike many other teams who swap members and break up over silly things. I think Fray will catch up with them if they stick at it, nE I'm not so sure. I have doubts on how long their going to stay together. If X&Y can stay together and work on things, *cross fingers* we can contest them. Thats always been my dream haha. 






**Toddles:** Team work, co-ordination and excellent position is what i belive places them above the rest. If we make 1 mistake Fray always seem to capitalise on it and make us pay, we haevn't played Infused and with NE there current line up is nothing like there old one they have traded godlike an extremely smart and well skilled for shifty who never gets any objective time and just gets kills which has impacted on their overall teams performance and it shows.






**ACL: Unless you have been living under a rock you will have no doubt be aware of the release of the ACL Halo Reach Community montage, edited by the talent of Asikk and Doofus. What did you think of the montage? And with the massive exposure of the first one (Over 25,000 views and counting) can we expect to see some X&Y clips in the second ACL community montage?**






**Karloo:** 3for1 on fray...haha. I will be submitting clips but i will submit after Melbourne.






**Royalfan:** The editing/song was sexy, but tbh I wasn't massively impressed with the clips. As for X&Y clips, I would like to contribute but all my DMR triples which could lead to overkills but get stolen by karl aren't very impressive haha. Nah, I really need to work on getting multi kills. Its shameful nothing comes my way. I was hoping for an X&Y montage but we'll see.






**Blainz:** The montage was sick and was a great way to promote ACL and showcase players clips. Things like a community montage were tried in the past but never really had any success so im suprised it did so well. Asikk and Doofus did a great job Ill have to get some clips to submit for the second one.






**Royalfan:** Sorry to sound like such a downer on the tage, the exposure was great, the second one will undoubtedly better because hopefully we will see more clips from scrims and v3.

**ACL:** Lets of course talk about now the long anticipated first LAN stop of the 2011 ACL Pro Circuit: ACL Melbourne. With 15 Halo Teams and 15 CoD teams signed up alone, not to mention the numerous Fifa 11 and fighting game players that are going to be in attendance ACL Melbourne is set to be the biggest ACL event yet. How is X&Y feeling coming into ACL Melbourne? Confident, prepared, nervous?






**Karloo:** A little nervous as i have no competitive lan experience.






**Blainz:** Bit nervous. Always takes me a while to get used to and feel comfortable on LAN so hopefully I can get some decent practice in beforehand but Im confident we'll perform well as a team.






**Toddles:** Im really keen to see how Reach plays on LAN but i think it will be a great event with lots of teams and hopefully it runs smoothly.






**Royalfan:** I CAN'T WAIT FOR ACL MELB! I've had lots of LAN experience but still nervous because this is the 'actual thing' and there will be heaps of people watching (and judging) but at the same time more confident than I have felt at any other LAN cause of the team I have. We all get on well. Also can't wait to meet my teammates and chill with people from other teams.






**ACL:** ACL Melbourne will not only be home to a Reach 4v4 tournament, but also the first official LAN stop of the ACL Reach FFA tournament. How do you guys rate yourself as FFA Players? I know you Toddles finished 8th in ACL FFA Online Round 1, making you a Pro FFA Player. Do you see yourself making top 8 again at Melbourne? Or maybe all of X&Y will make an appearance in the FFA finals?






**Blainz:** I used to be pretty decent at FFA's in halo 3. Not so sure about Reach. I keep forgetting to sign up haha Ill go do that now.






**Royalfan:** Todd is top 8 easy, people aren't prepared for the spam. I reckon out of our team Todd and Ian have the best chance of making it into the finals. I am just absolutely hopeless at FFA but I'm going to give it a good shot. 






**Karloo:** Hahah im just participating in FFA for fun not expecting finals or anything.






**Toddles:** Im hoping to make it to the FFA finals again after a disapointing last game in the online FFA and get a bit of redemption, it would be awesome if all of X&Y made it to the finals as  we all have the potential to but with so many good players out there like benno, cody and hopey i think for anyone it will be a challenge.






**Blainz:**

i wouldnt want X&Y to become too FFAmous anyway.

**ACL:** As you will no doubt know MLG have finally released the v3 settings a few weeks ago. How does X&Y feel about the changes made between v2 to v3 settings? Anything you love or hate about the changes? And have you guys grown fond or foul of sprint 






**Toddles:** I feel they are getting closer to perfecting there setting especially with the addition of new maps though i would like to see some king of the hill as i loved playing that on halo 3. Im not that fussed about sprint, i dont hate it or like it i just see it as a new aspect of the game just like bloom






**Karloo:** I am dissapointed king of the hill was thrown out and they kept bomb on zealot and sanc.






**Blainz:** No not really. Im liking the v3 settings as v2 was starting to drive me insane with the lack of maps. Other than that I dont think too much has changed. I love and I hate sprint I can never make up my mind, the game works quite well without it though. When I got a chance to play without sprint at a small Melbourne LAN using settings similar to that of MLG with increased speed, the game was pretty intense. 






**Royalfan:** Yeah I agree with Todd, I'm not a sprint hater, It's there, I'll use it the best I can. I reckon V3 is the best yet, I'm liking Nexus and Element though they'll take some getting used to. Worst thing about V3 is the recovery system of sitting right on the flag, it just makes everything so scrappy. I'd prefer the H3 system of the radius recovery.






**ACL:** As MLG Dallas is right around the corner, a week before ACL Melbourne, I'm sure its an event that not only X&Y, but almost all of ACL will be tuning in for. In the spirit of the epic weekend that is sure to ensue, lets hear your predictions for MLG Dallas. Top 3 will suffice.






**Roylafan:** Well tbh I haven't been following the pro teams that much since Reach came out but imexpecting that to change after the tourny. BUT IM GONNA HAVE TO go with my boys


1.) FB


2.) sQ


3.) DH






**Karloo:**

1.) FB


2.) DH 


3.) Impact






**Toddles:** I also haven't been following it to much but based on results from TLN and other things i have seen i would say:


1.)Darkest hour


2.)Instinct


3.)Belive the hype






**Blainz:**




1.) Darkest Hour


2.) Instinct


3.) Triggers Down






**ACL: As most Halo fans will know ACL has been updating their Youtube channel regularly with ACL Reach Pro Player Gameplays, which have been featuring some of the best gameplays from ACL's top players. ACL is keen to get their hands on some X&Y gameplay, have you got anything for us?**






**Blainz:** Do we?!?!?






**Toddles:** Depends what you are looking for. Hopefully you will be seeing some soon.






**Royalfan:** I have some against Outbreak.






**Blainz:** I have nothing






**Royalfan:** Beware can I just upload some to my FS and you can grab the best ones.






**Karloo:** Yeah we will get you some!






**ACL:** Thanks for your time Royal, Karloo, Toddles and Blainz but before we go I'm not sure if its only me who doesn't know but what is the exact meaning behind your team name X&Y?






**Royalfan:** HAHAHA






**Blainz:** I sure as hell dont. Axis' and maths and stuff.






**Toddles:** Well Royalfan?






**Royalfan:** Its a very cool name, and revealing its origins would ruin its mystery and appeal. All you need to know is it came from a highly intelligent and creative mind.






**ACL:** Thanks guy, and lets hear those shout outs!






**Karloo:** Shoutout to Peter and Chris for the late night lunging.






**Toddles:** Shoutout to Schmutt for being awesome and all the ACL staff for doing such a good job over the last couple of years and hopefully many more to come.






**Blainz:** Shoutouts to all all my old team members OHHD Pyro, Satiex and Midst the widdly scuds. Fury - Asikk, Cheez and Will. nE for being top blokes at wills LAN. Definietly not monk cause he forgot me in his Timeout and heaps of other I cbf to type out. You'll know who you are. And definitely not Monk because he forgot me in his timeout, did I mention monk? NOT MENTIONING ME. Jayce for letting me play with X&Y and Vanz for being drunk infront of my mum.






**Royalfan:** Shout outs to my teammates, Taylor(transitiion) and Jayce. Also Vanz for organizing Melb its going to be amazing. Thanks beware for interviewing us as well.






**ACL:** Thanks for the Timeout X&Y and best of luck at ACL Melbourne!
