**ACL: Now, you've competed in a fair few online competitions and have attended multiple ACL LANs across various titles, can you tell us a bit about your history with ACL and beforehand, AusHalo?**






**Somedude:**
 It all started late 2008 when Troy (Trazza), James (Cripsy), James (Crazyjoker) and myself watched the MLG Las Vegas Championships. It was such an awesome event and we were all hooked on the idea of competitive gaming so we wanted to see if we could find something similar in Australia. A month or so later, we found out about GoSolid and competed in a few LANS under the name of Team JJET.





Looking for a larger community, we found out about Aushalo and competed in the first online tournament in 2009. CrazyJoker left the team and we picked up Brandon (Brandz) and competed under the name of Prelude. Although we placed terribly, I found myself hooked on the idea of playing a video game competitively and so I continued to compete in Aushalo events.





Since that point on I've tried my best to stay in touch with the community by posting on the forums and competiting at LAN/Online events and although I was pretty garb at Halo 3, I'm extremely glad that I stuck with it throughout the 09' and 10' season until now, where I game FIFA instead at ACL.
