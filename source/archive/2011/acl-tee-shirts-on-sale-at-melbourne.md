**ACL has rushed out some tee shirts just in time for Melbourne LAN.**




That's right. Just in time for Melbourne, we will have some of 2011's hot tees for sale. We will be aiming to stock a few designs and a fuller range of merchandise this year, but we've managed to organise one design in time for April's event.





All profits will go to relaunching Stats Central for the 2011 season, as you would have noticed we have been struggling to get that up. There is a lot of work needed in developing and coding this, so be sure to support the cause.






**Price:**
 $25



**Sizes:**
 Unisex slim fit; S, M, L, XL, 2XL 





We will have 100 tees in the sizes listed above (only 5 x 2XLs). The design printed can be shown below, and is available only in the yellow colour. 





We will also be taking details for those interested in this year's hoodie range at the event.
