****ACL's Psykerpath launches Drop Bear Gaming Gear, providing gaming gear to the masses****





**[Drop Bear Gaming Gear](http://dbgaminggear.com.au/) was founded by Nathan Starkey with the premise of giving back to the gaming community by providing products and services that will allow each and every gamer to succeed. 


Drop Bear Gaming Gear is a website that aims to provide the very best of gaming equipment at the best price possible.


With the help of Drop Bear Gaming Gear and the members of the competitive community we will strive to see competitive gaming become more recognised and respected.**




Coming from an extensive background of both competing in and organising LAN events Nathan “Psykerpath” Starkey has seen the community grow and expand to new heights. In order for this trend to continue Nathan has recognised that the efforts of Nick Vanzetti and the staff at ACL need to be met with the assistance of other organisations. 





Drop Bear Gaming Gear boasts the ability to help all members of the community gain access to the best gaming gear at the best price. With the constant addition of new gear to the site and an ever-present eye on what the community wants and needs in order to succeed, Drop Bear Gaming Gear hopes that its partnership with ACL will help the competitive community take it to the next level.






**What Drop Bear Gaming Gear hopes to achieve**





**Discounts**





• Regular discounts for gamers (in the form of a promotional code)






**Promoting ACL**





• ACL will feature heavily on both the website and in any videos or promotions the site launches. 






**Giving back to the community**





• Drop Bear Gaming Gear will endeavour to be a principle sponsor in regard to the offering of gear and money for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place. We will also endeavour to try and provide some form of raffle prizes at events.  






**A message from Nathan**






Quote“Hey Guys, I just wanted to let you all know that whilst I have put countless hours into the development of this website its success lies entirely with you, the gamers; both casual and competitive as well as this community. Without your input I cannot give back to the community as much as I want or plan to”.
