**Today Beware from ACL sits down with Tranqulity from Team Initial Concept. Tranquility has had some impressive placements so far in the 2011 ACL Pro Circuit and is looking to improve upon them come ACL Sydney. Today we get his thoughts going into ACL Sydney and discuss Initial Concepts recent lineup change.**





**ACL: Thanks for sitting down with me Tranquillity, can you start off by telling us a bit of information about yourself?**





**Name:** Steve



**Gamertag:**  iC Tranquility



**State:** QLD



**Current Team:** Initial Concept



**Favourite Gametype:** Warlock TS/CTF, Sanctuary Bomb



**Controller settings:** 7 Sensitivity, Recon, No Vibration.



**Hobbies:** Gaming, relaxing and enjoying life.






**ACL: Tell us a bit about your gaming background and how you originally found out about ACL?**





**Tranquility:** Well I’ve been playing video games my whole life, and always wanted to eventually play games at events and stuff.  Two years ago I got an Xbox after finding out about MLG, then proceeded to try and find somewhere in Australia that does the same.  I posted on the Bungie forums and someone sent me to Aushalo.






**ACL: Tell us a little bit about your previous Halo experience since you starting competing in ACL tournaments?**





**Tranquility:** I hadn’t really played Halo much aside from going to friend’s houses.  I started playing around September 2009, got to know a few people online and ended up teaming with Tosh, Darkspawn and Bahoo.  However broke up with them a few days before Melbourne LAN in 2010 and placed 7th with Jim, Shifty and Icevayne.






**ACL: Looking back on ACL Melbourne, Initial Concept placed seven. Not a bad placement in any regards, but you boys seemed to be disappointed with it. What went wrong that event? What stopped iC from placing higher?**





**Tranquility:**  Honestly I believe I had a lot to do with us losing against Game.  We were up 2-1 in the series and after narrowly losing Game 4 on Element CTF I became frustrated and played terrible in the final game.  Also Darkspawn was always very busy which limited our time to practise as a whole team,  along with Jim’s net dying a lot.  Me dropping from 7 sensitivity to 3 for the event didn’t help either.






**ACL: After Melbourne iC made a team change, and you guys picked up Chantelle in place of Darkspawn. What was the reason for this team change and what lead to the decision of picking up Chantelle?**





**Tranquility:**  Well Darkspawn never played much as I said before, and after Melbourne he told us he didn’t have the time to play and quit Halo completely.  We looked around for a while afterwards and Jim was talking with Chantelle, she seemed pretty keen and we picked her up.






**ACL: Going into ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2 you guys still had Chantelle and seemed confident to do well. After Pro Pool Play iC had third seed going into the Pro Double Elimination tournament on Sunday were you ultimately placed 6th (breaking your 7th place curse 
![;)](http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/public/style_emoticons/<#EMO_DIR#>/wink.gif)). Tell us about that placement, where you guys as a team happy with your performance and your 6th place finish?**





**Tranquility:**  We were feeling really confident all tournament long.  We lost a few games in pool play due to my internet cutting out near the end of games, but most games we won we did pretty solid.  The next day we won our first series against TSW and 4G and were feeling great but got 3-0’d by VX.  Loser’s Bracket was definitely disappointing for us, we lost our series against Fury after being up 2-0.  However breaking the 7th curse was a great feeling.






**ACL: Not many may know but Initial Concept came extremely close to securing a top 4 finish. In your series against Fury for Top 4, and then your placement series against Category 5 for 5th iC was up 2-0 in both series only for both teams to come back and beat you guys 3-2. What happened in these series? What stopped you guys from being able to close out those wins?**





**Tranquility:**  We got outplayed.  The two game types we seemed to lose the most, the bomb game types, were both game 3’s and we never seemed to be able to even get the bomb into their base.  It seemed that this killed our momentum and lost us both series.  






**ACL: Leading up to ACL Sydney the Initial Concept line up almost seemed set in stone,  then less than two weeks out from the event Chantelle left the team. What happened to cause this? And how did it affect your team?**





**Tranquility:**  Even though we placed well in R2, we never seemed to have that chemistry with Chantelle that the rest of us have with each other.  She has a much more passive play style than the rest of us and it just didn’t seem to work and we felt like we lost a lot of games due to this, especially bomb where you need to be very aggressive to get the bomb into the other teams base.  I think she felt like it wasn’t working as well and left to join Hopey and Dark’s team.






**ACL: So for ACL Sydney your lineup is now Tranquility, Jim, Stryfe and Jayce. Is Jayce a permanent member of iC, or just on iC for this event? How does playing with Jayce compare to playing with Chantelle?**





**Tranquility:**  We played a few games last night and it already feels like we have much better chemistry than we did with Chantelle.  Jayce has a lot of slaying power and he’s much more aggressive which blends well with our playstyle.  I feel if we keep practising we’ll soon know whether he’s the 4th we’ve been looking for, it’s looking good so far.






**ACL: Many members seem to be making some very generic predictions coming into ACL Sydney. Understandable due to the recent horde of team changes and the unexpected results in ACL Reach 4v4 Online Round 2, but what are your clear top 8 predictions for ACL Sydney?**





**Tranquility:**  I feel the difference between teams right now is so small that there are a lot of teams that can compete for 2-6.  





1. Immunity


2. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE


3. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE


4. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE


5. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE


6. iC/X&Y/nE/dE/bE


7. Distinctive/Fury


8. Distinctive/Fury






**ACL: Of course alongside the 4v4 Reach event at ACL Sydney there will be the Reach FFA tournament. You came out very dominant at ACL Melbourne placing third, and then 4th in ACL FFA Reach Online Round 2. Do you consider yourself a strong FFA player? And what aspects of your playstyle from 4v4 carry over to FFA?**





**Tranquility:**  I’m kind of amazed I did so well in both FFA’s because I’m not a big fan of them and always considered myself a terrible FFA player.  I think the reason I did so well is because I have a solid DMR and I’m pretty good at surviving and cleaning up one shots.






**ACL: Give us a rough prediction on what you think the results of the FFA tournament at ACL Sydney will be? Which players are you expecting to see in the Finals?**





**Tranquility:**  I’d have to say someone from  Immunity will win, most likely Benno.  They’re all so much more individually skilled than most players that I’d be surprised if we didn’t see at least two of them in the finals.  I’d also throw Hopey in there since he’s definitely one of the most skilled players in Australia at the moment.  Aside from that it’s anyone’s guess who ends up in the finals since there’s so many good players.






**ACL: MLG v5 gametypes and setting are rumoured to be released quite shortly. Judging on what you have seen or played in the v5 test settings what do you like and dislike about v5? What would you love to see added in v5?**





**Tranquility:**  I haven’t had much of a chance to play v5.  Honestly the only thing I’d love to see in v5 is the return of game types like Oddball and  KOTH.  I feel that only playing Flag, Slayer and Bomb game types all the time can get kind of boring and I hate that they took out Oddball and KOTH just because of spectators at MLG events.  I can’t see them improving the game types much more without them.






**ACL: Thanks for your time Tranquility! Before I let you go however I have to ask: are the rumours true? Is Lunar actually better than you like he claims?**





**Tranquility:**  I think we’ll settle that once and for all next time we meet at a LAN.  Come at me Lunar.






**ACL: Haha got any shoutouts?**





**Tranquility:**  Deano, <3 you.  The rest of iC for being awesome teammates, and my parents for driving me to every LAN for the past year and a half.






**ACL: Sweet! Goodluck to you and Initial Concept at ACL Sydney!**
