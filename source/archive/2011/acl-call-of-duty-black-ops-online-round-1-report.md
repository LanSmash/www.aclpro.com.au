Closest5 
**(Grand Finalist)**


Fray


Taunted


Mindfreak.RAZER





Closet5 went through the whole day undefeated and only dropped one map the whole final series, now they eagerly await their next opponent in the grand final.





The end of the day finished with an intense match up between Mindfreak.RAZER and Taunted in the loser bracket to see who would be out and who would advance to the top 3.


 


Mindfreak.RAZER got the victory in a score of 3-1 and will advance to the semi final against Fray,these two teams also versed each other earlier in the day and Fray came away with a narrow 3-0 win with 2 of the 5 maps being drawn, so be sure to be watching for the rematch.
