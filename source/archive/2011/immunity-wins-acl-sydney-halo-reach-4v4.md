**In a dominating fashion, Team Immunity took the ACL Sydney Halo: Reach 4v4 finals**




The question on everyone's mind going into the ACL Sydney LAN was whether or not Immunity's pick up of ex-team mate Slayer was the right choice. With only weeks of practice in Halo: Reach from Halo 3, would he perform under pressure? Any doubt was silenced as the weekend progressed.

Immunity started strong on Saturday only dropping one game in a Pool Play tie breaker against Fury. The rest of their opponents copped a thrashing in the form of quick 3-0 flag games and slayer steaktaculars.





During Saturday, Voltage of Immunity showed off his practised gameplay and won the Halo: Reach FFA.





On Sunday, Immunity made quick work of all opponents. A surprise team came out of nowhere; Distinctive, their first time attending a LAN as a team. They met in the Winner's Finals. Unfortunately, Distinctive's momentum could not shut down a practised Immunity squad and was sent to the Loser's Bracket with a 3-0.





After Distinctive arguably upset Halo 3 superstars Break Even, the finals were set. Immunity v Distinctive.





In an incredible display of team work, communication and consistency Immunity 3-0'd Distinctive yet again winning the ACL Sydney Halo: Reach 4v4 6-0.
