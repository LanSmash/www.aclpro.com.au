**Season 2 of the 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is underway and this past Sunday we played host to the third official Call of Duty Online Round of 2013; ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 3. We saw an impressive talent pool of 44 teams from across Australia and New Zealand battle it out in the hopes of claiming the top spot as their own.**




Once again we had valuable Season and Yearly points for the taking so teams had plenty to fight for and plenty to prove. The competition fielded the best names in Australia and New Zealand Call of Duty including the likes of Avant, Mindfreak, Noxious and the Plantronics ACL Brisbane winners, Team Immunity. This tournament was seeded by Season Points earned in Season 1, though Season 2 will carry its own individual points for Points for Players. With the existing lineups combined with new teams signing up we had an excellent tournament on our hands.





Round 1 was a very tame set of matches. Almost all teams who progressed won convincingly 2-0, the closest series being Team Pulse vs Team Intervene ending 2-1 Pulse's way, paving the way for the Winners Bracket. 





Round 2 saw a lot more action with notable match ups including: Inspire vs Dignify, where Inspire pulled through 2-1, freQuency vs seQuence, which saw two teams with similar names battle out to the very end. freQuency edged seQuence out 2-1 moving them through to WBR3. The highlight match up would have to have been Sensual CoD Clan narrowly knocking Saikyo to the Losers Bracket in a 2-1 fashion. The other matches in WBR2 had a pretty standard result of 2-0.





Winners Bracket Round 3 saw a very similar range of results to Round 2. The majority of matches were a straight 2-0 result, however a we did have a few close matches.


Fame took out a strong rickross lineup 2-1 and Sensual CoD Clan caused somewhat of an upset knocking 4th place ACL Brisbane team Noxious to the Losers Bracket.





Immunity continued their dominance moving through the Winners Bracket in Round 4, taking out Mindfreak in a 2-0 clean sweep. Fame had a close encounter with Team Emperor which ultimately saw them being knocked to the Losers Bracket as Team Emperor took the win 2-1. Coup de Grace vs Avant was a highlight grudge-match of the tournament, considering the history shared between the two teams,  however Coup De Grace proved too strong on the day walking away with a 2-0 vicoty. Myth.EP vs Sensual CoD Clan was another great matchup, which ended in Myth putting a halt to Sensual CoD Clan's winning streak by winning 2-0.





Up next we had Winners Bracket Round 5, or the Winners Bracket Semi-Final. Immunity maintained their composure throughout the tournament taking out an on fire Team Emperor squad 3-0 and Coup De Grace continued their dominance bidding farewell to Myth.EP 3-0 respectively.





This brings us to the Winners Bracket Final. Both Immunity and Coup de Grace had not dropped a map coming into this match so we were in for an epic match up. The match started off with what looked to be an easy 3-0 for Immunity after starting Hardpoint Slums with a 100 point lead. Coup de Grace knew if they dug deep they could bring it back and managed just that to bring control back in their favor as they took out the first map. Search and Destroy Raid was up next and Coup de Grace took it out convincingly 6-2, which some speculation and raised eyebrows at Naked's Riotsheild strat. All of sudden Immunity were one game away from being knocked to the Losers Bracket, which would of been a first for this dynasty of a squad. Immunity decided today was not going to be that day as the stepped up their game taking out Game 3 Capture the Flag Standoff with an easy 5 captures. In Game 4 Hardpoint Yemen was extremely close for the majority of the game, however, Immunity started taking control towards the end of the game and took the map by 60 points. It all came down to the final map; Search and Destroy Standoff. The map started off going round for round before Immunity took 3 straight to make it 5-2. Coup de Grace were dropping like flies leaving Ray in a 1v3 situation. Ray managed to take down Shockz before being baited in by Naked's Riotshield and getting cleaned up by Fighter. Team Immunity take out the Winners Bracket Final winning three straight rounds and earning themselves a spot in the Grand Final.





Moving on to Losers Bracket Round 1. Traumatize were the only team to put up a fight before being knocked out by Infinite. The other teams all advanced to Losers Bracket Round 2.


Losers Bracket Rounds 2-4 were much of the same. The vast majority of matches were 2-0 clean sweeps with very few seeing any major competition.





Coming into Losers Bracket Round 5 we were finally in for some great CoD. Mindfreak and Avant beat their opponents 3-0 advancing them to the next round. Noxious had to work for their spot in the next round after Fame took a round from them early on. Noxious progressed after a 3-1 win. NoChance and Sensual CoD Clan saw one of the best matches of the tournament up next. Both teams were playing superbly, bringing the match to the 5th and final map. NoChance pulled through securing their spot in the tournament with SCC being knocked out.





LBR6 continued the trend with a couple of impressive match ups. Noxious vs Mindfreak and Avant vs NoChance. Noxious took out Mindfreak with relative ease, only dropping one map however Avant were not so lucky. Vilesyder's mid-series disappearance act did them no favours as NoChance were here for the win and fought right down to the last map. Avant managed to take it out 3-2 but it was an excellent match to watch, with lots of cheeky smack talk thrown around in game and on twitter.





The next round in the Losers Bracket saw Noxious and Avant continue their dominance. Team Emperor stood no chance against Avantâ€™s momentum ending their journey in a 3-0 fashion. Myth.EP were ready for a fight and slowed Noxious right down taking the match to the final map. Noxious proved to be too strong and took it out winning the match 3-2.





Losers Bracket Semi Finals were up next with both Noxious and Avant ready to battle it out for a top 3 finish. Avant were riding their momentum and looked unstoppable coming into this match but Noxious were here to prove otherwise, starting to really their grove. Dominating Avant 3-0 knocking them out of the tournament and advancing themselves to the Losers Bracket Finals.





Noxious were in a great mindset and their match vs Coup de Grace looked to be a great one for spectators. Noxious looked good but unfortunately for them it wasn't enough. Coup de Grace were just too strong all tournament long and this series was no different as they took out Noxious 3-0 advancing to the Grand Final.





The Grand Final was up next and because both teams had met previously this was to be a continuation series. After being dropped to the Losers Bracket by Team Immunity, Coup de Grace were down 3-2 and wanted revenge. They started CTF Slums strong, taking out the game and bringing the series back 3 a piece. Immunity seemed to need a quick warm up and proved that by taking Hardpoint Raid after a 160 point lead. This summed up the rest of the Grand Final with Immunity taking Search and Destroy Express 6-2 and with hardly any winning confidence shown by Coup De Grace in Game 9 also taking out CTF Raid 5-2. As the dust settled, Immunity walked away ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 3 - Season 2 Champions winning the Grand Final 6-3.





Congratulations to Team Immunity for gaining yet another tournament win under their belts, doing so only dropping 3 maps the entire tournament and Coup de Grace for taking the 2nd place finsh and being the only team strong enough to take maps of Immunity. The Top 24 results can be seen below:
