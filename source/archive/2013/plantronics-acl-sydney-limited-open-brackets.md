**Plantronics ACL Sydney opens its door to a limited Open Bracket!**





**At the beginning of 2013, the Sydney event was announced as invite only. This event marks the culmination of the entire year's competition and those teams who have accumulated season points through good placings and repeat attendance are invited to attend. ACL maintains that these teams and players who have earned their spot deserve to be recognised for their efforts throughout the year.





ACL has heard the calls for an Open Bracket for Starcraft 2 and CoD: Black Ops 2 and put it to the community to pitch in to make it happen. Since this announcement, we have received numerous responses from active community members wishing to put their hands up to help. Although we have 
NOT YET locked in the required amount of volunteers necessary to go ahead with a limited Open Bracket for both titles ACL is taking it in good faith that we can lock in the final few volunteers to ensure we are not understaffed for the communities requests and are announcing tonight a limited Open Bracket for Starcraft 2 and CoD: Black Ops 2.**





**Starcraft 2:**


Starcraft 2 at ACL Sydney has already been advertised to invite the top 16 players based on ACL Season Points for the top 8 and ACL Season 3 Points (Online 5 & 6) for the bottom 8. ACL is now proud to announce that it will open its doors to an additional 32 players (48 players in total for the event) in a limited open bracket that will be hosted and completed on Saturday of ACL Sydney. More details regarding the the process of determining the 32 players for the Open Bracket will be released shortly. 





From the Open Bracket 8 players will progress to Sunday and play in the Championship Bracket for Starcraft 2. The Championship Bracket will feature the top 16 invited players and the 8 players that progressed from the Open Bracket battle it out until one player is crowned the ACL Sydney Champion.





We still required an additional volunteer to assist with the bump in and bump out process to finalise the Starcraft 2 team. If you are available on Friday the 18th and Sunday night on the 20th and would like to assist with this process please email info@aclpro.com.au.






**CoD: Black Ops 2:**


Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 at ACL Sydney has already been advertised to invite the top 8 teams based on ACL Season Points for the top 4 teams and ACL Season 3 Points (Online 5 & 6) for the bottom 4 teams. ACL is now proud to announce that it will open its doors to an additional 12 teams (20 in total for the event) in a limited open bracket that will be hosted and completed on the Saturday of ACL Sydney. More details regarding the the process of determining the 12 teams for the Open Bracket will be released shortly. 





From the Open Bracket 4 teams will progress to Sunday and play in the Championship Bracket for CoD: Black Ops 2. The Championship Bracket will feature the top 8 invited teams and the 4 teams that progressed from the Open Bracket battle it out until one team is crowned the ACL Sydney Champions.

If you are available on Friday the 18th and Sunday night on the 20th for bump in/bump out or are available on Saturday the 19th and Sunday the 20th to be a tournament admin and would like to assist with this either of these areas please email info@aclpro.com.au.
