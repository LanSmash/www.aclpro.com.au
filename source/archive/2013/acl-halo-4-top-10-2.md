**Presenting ACL's second Halo 4 Top 10!**





**In February we asked you, the Australian & New Zealand Halo community, to submit to us your best clips and plays you had obtained so far in Halo 4. You responded again with a large influx of submissions and we were not disappointed by the quality! We are now pleased to announce Halo 4 Top 10 #2 showing off the skill the ACL community has to offered, commentated over by ACL Halo Admin Hoggy!**











Be sure to keep an eye out for future ACL Halo 4 top 10's and be sure to save your stand out clips for future submissions!
