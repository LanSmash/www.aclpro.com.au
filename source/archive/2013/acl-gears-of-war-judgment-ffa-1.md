**Tournament Structure:**


The Gears of War Judgment Free For All Tournaments are for individuals looking to test their skills against others in a chaotic battle where every man plays for themselves. A typical round will pit 8 players against each other at once on designated FFA maps.


Each game has a 25 kill limit.


Progression to the next round is not based on a set number. Because attendees at each tournament differ greatly, a formula that means ‘top 4 progress’ is not always applicable. While this rule is followed where possible, there are often some advancements for odd numbers based on these statistics:


Place > Kills > K/D > Assists > Deaths.


That means, in some instances, players who place 5th or less may still progress based on those statistics in comparison to players in the same position in other pools. Ie:If 2 extra spots are available for progression for 5th placers, ACL will look at who had more kills first.





The Two Tier Structure:


Round 1 – Will determine Tier A and Tier B Bracket:


Tier A


Tier B


All players start in Tier A FFA Round 1. From there players who place Top 4 in FFA Round 1 will continue their progression through the Tier A bracket. Players who place below Top 4 in FFA Round 1 will progress through the Tier B Bracket.


Tier A: Tier A is made up of the top 4 placing players from each FFA Round and the bracket will progress all the way to the Tier A Finals. If you place outside the top 4 in a FFA Round (unless its Tier A FFA Round 1) then you are knocked out of the FFA Tournament.


Tier B: Tier B is made up of the players who placed below top 4 in Tier A FFA Round 1. Tier B works exactly the same as Tier A, players progress through the Tier B bracket by placing in the top 4 in their Rounds, and if they place below Top 4 then you are knocked out of the FFA Tournament.
