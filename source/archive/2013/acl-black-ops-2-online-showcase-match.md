**Introducing the first ACL CoD: Black Ops 2 Online Showcase Match!**





**You asked for it, so here it is! Australian Cyber League is hosting its first Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Online Showcase match, a best of 11 series featuring some of the best teams in Australia & New Zealand, showcased to the ANZ community and hopefully an even wider audience. These showcase matches will be streamed lived and commentated over by the best Call of Duty commentators our region has to offer, a chance to show off the talent of our players and casters alike. ACL would like to use these showcase matches as an opportunity to reach out to the community for any talented members who would like to apply to involved in these (hopefully) weekly showcases matches, but more about that below!**

**How you can help!**

ACL Black Ops 2 Online Showcase Matches will continue on a (hopefully) weekly basis from the first addition. The biggest hurdle to overcome to keep these live-streams consist is securing skilled commentators to highlight the gameplay. These commentators must be experienced, knowledgeable, and display fluent commentator skills and if successful this opportunity could lead to commentating at live events. If you feel you fit these prerequisites you may apply by submitting a sample of your work (can be either a live stream rebroadcast or a youtube video) by adding Beware to skype on 'damiencauci'. You do not need to have the capabilities to stream to commentate, at the moment streaming will be done by ACL. Bio Acid will not be around forever and is not always available, we need more than one CoD Caster in ANZ.
