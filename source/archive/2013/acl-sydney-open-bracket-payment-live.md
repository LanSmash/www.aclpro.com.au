**Plantronics ACL Sydney Open Bracket Payment Live!**









**The Plantronics ACL Sydney Open Brackets for CoD: Black Ops 2 and Starcraft 2 are now open! There are limited spots for both so get in thick! As we have announced, the first teams to pay will be the teams that secure a spot, so pay quick to not miss out!.**





**Key Points:**





 - The only way to secure an Open Bracket spot is to purchase an Public Registration pass for Starcraft 2 or Black Ops 2. The Black Ops 2 passes are team passes (no individual passes for team games). No Open Bracket spots will be held for any teams/players under any circumstances without payment.


 - Entry to the Open Bracket is released in two stages. 'Open Invites' and 'Public Registration'. The Open Invite stage is now over and Public Registration has begun.


 - Payment for 'Public Registration' opens on Wednesday the 18th at 7.30pm AEST. At this time the first players/teams to buy their player/team pass will be the players/teams attending the event. First in, best dressed.
