**ACL 2013 Further Details Released!**





**ACL is pleased to release further details of its 2013 circuit, with a live webcast to follow early in the new year on the topic. 2013 will see some revolutionary changes to ACL’s year-long event structures, unlike any ACL circuit before.**




The Australian Cyber League has always been committed to providing the biggest, most exciting and most professional gaming circuit in Australia. Since 2006, we've been on a never-ending learning curve, finding out what the Australian gaming community wants and striving to deliver it.





2013 will bring with it some necessary changes to the ACL circuit. Some of these changes have already been outlined in the 2013 circuit teaser. If you missed the teaser, ACL’s season structure is undergoing revolutionary change, moving away from an annual year-long circuit, to being broken down into 3 distinct seasons for 2013.





The ACL 2013 circuit will also bring renewed focus to online events, making them more important than ever. 






**STRUCTURE OVERVIEW - ACL Seasons**




ACL will have 3 distinct seasons in 2013, each season being 8-12 weeks in length. This structure gives ACL the ability to add or remove aspects of the circuit, even supported titles, without having the downside of having to wait an entire year. This will also give gamers the chance to be crowned champions without penalising them for not attending every event of the year. That said, there will still incentives to attend as many events as possible.






**HOW IT WILL WORK - Season Structure**




Each of the 3 seasons will consist of an online competition (2 for Season 1) and a LIVE event. The online competition, whilst a tournament in itself, will also decide seeding for the season’s upcoming LIVE event. Points will reset each Season, however, a yearly background points system will be in place seeding the finals event.






**LAN Event Structure – First 2 Seasons**





**Team Games**
: The Top 4 placing teams from the online competition seed straight into the Top 4 positions in the live event bracket. These teams are classified as the Pro Teams for that season. The remaining spots in the bracket will then be fought for at the event.






**Individuals**
: Similar to Team Games structure but with a higher number of Pro Players. This structure is being refined with SC2 Admins whilst taking the launch of Heart of the Swarm into consideration.



**LAN Event Structure – Finals**




Yearly season points will seed the Top 4 teams for 4v4 titles and Top 8 players from 1v1 titles straight into the invite online final event. One or more online tournaments will seed additional teams and players invited to the final event.





8 teams will be invited for 4v4 titles and 16 players for 1v1 titles.






**LAN Event Schedule:**





Note: Although these are likely, please do not book any accommodation/airfares until the official announcement. These dates and locations are subject to change.





**April – Brisbane


July – Melbourne


September/October – Sydney – NATIONAL FINALS**






**Confirmed Titles:**




Titles are still to be confirmed. We can however confirm that Starcraft 2, Halo 4 and CoD Black Ops 2 will be in Season 1 with the possibility of more titles being added.



**Words from the Director**:





Gamers, it is with great pleasure that we unveil some of our plans for 2013. Since meeting at our summit, where ACL's top organisers sat down to strategise 2013, we have set a very clear direction for where we want to go this year. I had hoped we would be able to provide you with some more detailed information on next year's event schedule and game lineup. Unfortunately due to the enormity of our vision, we are still in a heavy negotiating and planning phase at this time. While we work out the finer details with vendors, sponsors and venues, take this information as a guide for how we see the year taking shape. There will definitely be some much bigger announcements in the future that includes some of the points I mentioned earlier, and even beyond that, but for the meantime please take this for what it is - an outline to 2013 for ACL.





Thank you for your patience and I look forward to what looks to be an incredible year!
