**Plantronics ACL Brisbane Wrap Up**


Written by Baldie, Neon, Hoggy & Midnite





**The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is underway and our first stop of the year was in Brisbane at the Mercure Hotel over April 13th-14th for Platronics ACL Brisbane! Plantronics Gamecom provided an abundance of their fantastic products for gamers to utlise as well as a heavy contribution to the $9000 prize pool up for grabs over the weekend. BenQ also provided their amazing RL2450H monitors for the Starcraft II, CoD: Black Ops 2 & Halo mainstage, which meant competitors were in for a treat.**

Plantronics ACL Brisbane went off with a bang and showcased an incredible weekend of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Halo 4 and Starcraft II boasting some of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand. This is event saw the first National scale live event for all 3 titles and was the first chance for players and teams to prove themselves and stand out from the rest of the crowd in 2013. Coming into the event we saw 52 of Australia and New Zealand's best Stacraft II players turn up, all gunning for that number 1 spot. In a scene that had predominantly been dominated by big names such as mOOnGLaDe, PiG, Mafia, Tgun did any new or upcoming players have what it takes to take down these juggernauts in the new expansion? Looking at Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and the slight shift in team changes from Modern Warfare 3 to Black Ops 2 who could confidently say they were the best of the best? All eyes were on Immunity of course, but this was their first Australia LAN in a new game to prove themselves. Halo 4 was a mixed bag of tricks as the scene had completely changed from Halo: Reach to Halo 4. Some big names were gone, and some big names had made way for themselves in the new title, but this would be the first event that would definitively decide who was the best.

Over 150 competitors walked through the doors of Plantronics ACL Brisbane and this was everyone's first chance to be crowned champions. With $9000 in prize money available across all titles and vital Season and Yearly Points that would benefit players all year long on the table players had a lot riding on their performance and the results of this weekend.

It's 8.30am on a Brisbane Saturday morning and gamers eagerly wait to enter the Mercure Hotel for a weekend of gaming. Pro Players start to make their way into the venue receiving their special pro zone passes as general players register for the open bracket. Signups close at 10.30am and the weekend is decided. Starcraft 2 would see 16 pre-seeded pros await their remaining 8 opponents in a 36 man open bracket. Game on.





There were lots of changes to Plantronics ACL Brisbane, the first of three seasons on the 2013 circuit. This event saw the implementation of two sets on stage, noise cancelling headphones and player cam TVs on either end of the stage. Not to forget the brand new Pro Zone and retreat area for the top 16 Starcraft 2 pros to utilize.





The day starts with a double elimination open bracket. This was sure to be one of the fiercest open brackets with names such as Nv.Rossi, Nv.Deth, Nv.JazBas along with New Zealand Protoss player xGKing.Stallion fighting amongst the pack. There was also a special guest from Germany called Teddy who messaged ACL staff expressing interest to play. As a backpacker he had no mouse or keyboard so was allowed to borrow equipment from Staff. We had no idea how well this man was about to play! 





The first game on stream would be none other than Rossi, a Terran powerhouse, against Myth.ZenAku, a rising Protoss player. There was no doubt in a lot of people's minds that Rossi was the favourite in this best of 3, however ZenAku had a point to prove. Taking the first game, ZanAku looked strong to take the set however Rossi rallied winning back-to-back wins to take the set 2-1. Rossi remained on stage to then take on his round 2 opponent; Av.Pezz, another strong Protoss player. This time Rossi was unable to deliver the goods and was knocked to the lower brackets with a 0-2 defeat.





Rossi would then spend the remainder of the day fighting his way through lower brackets. He became one of the great Day 1 stories the tournament not dropping a single map while in the lower bracket until the finals! To put that in perspective he went into the open bracket finals with a map score of 20-4! Speaking of open bracket finals, Rossi's opponent would be his teammate Nv.JazBas who remained in the winners bracket with a map score of 10-2. Both players decided they best save their energy for pool play and made a gentleman's agreement to split the open bracket winnings between each other and move into separate groups.






**Open Bracket Top 8 with selected pool:**


1.	Nv. JazBas - A


2.	Nv.Rossi - C


3.	Teddy - A


4.	Av.NXZ - C


5.	Azz - B


6.	FvR.Shockwave - B


7.	SLCN.Petrify - D


8.	Nv.Deth - D





Another new format change to ACL Brisbane in 2013 was the earlier start of the Pool Stage with the top 16 playing as many games as possible at the same time as the open bracket. As the remainder of open bracket played out, attention from the stream shifted to the games people wanted to see the most. We saw matches streamed with competitors such as mOOnGLaDe, MaFia and Light fighting it out.





First pool play game on stream was iM.tgun vs AuX.MegaFonzie. Tgun was quick to show his innovation taking the first game with some arguably uncommon mass mutalisk play. Second game was also an interesting strategy with nydus/swarm host/queen play. With a 2-0 victory tgun was on his way to a top 8 birth however some mixed results led to a situation where tgun was relying on other results for him to advance. Needing NXZ to lose to x5.PiG to advance, tgun was noticeably uncomfortable. Having come out of open bracket and through pool play, NXZ was surprising everybody and with 2-1 wins over tgun and TN.nomad and 2-0 wins over PiG and MegaFonzie. Unfortunately for tgun NXZ 2-0 win against PiG secured a NXZ the 2nd seed spot out of groups, knocking tgun into the 3rd place seed.





Group D, considered the group of Death by many, consisted of iM.MaFia, xGKing.KingKong, fray'fenner, fray'Iaguz, joined by open bracket seeds SLCN.Petrify and Deth. This proved to be the biggest slugfest for 2 of the championship seeds. When groups were revealed Iaguz was feeling extremely confident and made a comment about the status of Zerg in HotS and that "KingKong is the only Zerg who can micro". MaFia returned fire with "I don't think I've ever lost to Iaguz in a tournament before". From there a grudge match was born. Close to $500 in bets flooded the SC2SEA scene in the week leading into ACL Brisbane, making Iaguz vs MaFia the most anticipated set of the event. Iaguz made short work of MaFia with some strong play and perhaps the help of some money mine hits taking the set 2-0, knocking MaFia out of contention for championships.





Other groups saw some great sets with a total of 3 open bracket seeds making championship round (Deth, JazBas and NXZ) making it the most of any ACL event to date. Teddy narrowly missed making it out of groups losing one more map than JazBas and fray'Petraeus looked unstoppable sweeping his group without dropping a single map. mOOnGLaDe looked strong as expected losing only to iM.Light.






**Pool Play Top 8:**


1.	fray'Petraeus


2.	iM.Light


3.	x5.PiG


4.	xGKing.KingKong


5.	Av.NXZ


6.	Nv.Deth


7.	Nv.JazBas


8.	Nv.mOOnGLaDe





The time had come for the top 8 players of ACL Brisbane to fight it out for their share of $2,500. 6 Zergs, 1 Protoss and 1 Terran. Another double elimination bracket meant players still had two chances to make it to the finals. On stage Light took on JazBas with a 2-1 victory to JazBas while off stage Petraeus 2-1'd mOOnGLaDe, KingKong 2-0'd NXZ and PiG 2-0'd Deth. Arguable favourite KingKong maintained his strong performances staying in the winners bracket to the grand finals taking out Petraeus and PiG 2-1 and 2-0 respectively.





Meanwhile in the lower bracket the two non-Zergs in Light and Deth were forced to fight and as a result the only Terran hope was defeated. NXZ surprised everybody taking out mOOnGLaDe 2-0 and he wasn't finished there, continuing to take out JazBas 2-0 before being stopped by Light 1-2. NXZ showed off a valiant effort from coming through the open brackets and pool play to finish 4th.





In the lower bracket finals the final Protoss hope in Light was defeated earning him a 3rd place finish. The grand finals had the potential to be somewhat of a story similar to ACL Melbourne in 2012 where PiG won back-to-back best of 3s. However in this case KingKong proved to be too strong taking it out 2-0 in the first best of 3.






**Championship Bracket Top 8:**


1.	xGKing.KingKong


2.	x5.PiG


3.	iM.Light


4.	Av.NXZ


5.	fray'Petraeus


6.	Nv.JazBas


7.	Nv.mOOnGLaDe


8.	Nv.Deth





Overall many considered Plantronics ACL Brisbane to be the best ACL event since Starcraft 2 was brought onto the circuit in early 2012. There are some changes and improvements to be made along the way but this looks like it could be a big year for ACL and Starcraft 2!

With $3,500 and valuable Season and Yearly points up for grabs this gave teams plenty to fight for, plenty to prove and spectators plenty of action to enjoy for Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. The competition fielded some of the best names in Australia and New Zealand Call of Duty including the likes of AVANT.GARDE, Myth.WF, Noxious Gaming and Team Immunity who recently competed in the CoD Championships in LA.





With 17 teams signed up for Plantronics ACL Brisbane teams had to fight through Pool Play to determine seeds for the Double Elimination Bracket.. Team Immunity, Myth.WF, AVANT.GARDE and NoChance already secured themselves the top seeds through Season Points earned through placing highly in the ACL Online Rounds, which meant they did not have to participate in Pool Play and were guaranteed the seeds 1st - 4th in the Double Elimination bracket.  





Saturday morning saw teams seeded 5th-17th battle it out in Pool Play. With 2 pools of 4 teams and 1 of 5 players were in for an intense day of competition. Fame and Noxious plowed through their respective pools, with their results tied these teams had to face off in a tiebraker to determine the 5th seed going through to the Double Elimination Bracket. Hardpoint Standoff was the tiebreak match with Noxious taking it out in a fairly convincing fashion.

**Pool Play Results:**



**[Pool A](http://challonge.com/PACLBrisCoDPA)


[Pool B](http://challonge.com/PACLBrisCoDPB)


[Pool C](http://challonge.com/PACLBrisCoDPC)**




Double Elimination started with the lowest seeds, Tac5 and Hydra eSports, fighting to make it into Winners Bracket Round 2 with all the other teams. Tac5 started the day off strong forcing Hydra into the Losers Bracket and moving into Round 2.





Winners Bracket Round 2 was almost a clean sweep across the board. Inspire were the only team to take a map from their opponent, Trident.tb.





Winners Bracket Round 3 saw Immunity and AVANT continue their dominance taking out their opponents 3-0. Myth and Cruelty Infearnate had an amazing matchup, with both teams tied an even 2-2 in the series the match went right down to the line. Myth managed to pull through and knock Cruelty Infearnate to the Losers Bracket. Noxious dropped a map against NoChance but showed their dominance beating them 3-1.





Immunity continued their dominance in Winners Bracket Round 4 still not dropping a map. Myth and AVANT had a much closer series where Myth edged out AVANT 3-1 progressing them through to the Winners Bracket Final.





With Team Immunity and Myth.WF in the Winners Bracket Final both teams were fighting for their spot in the Grand Final. Team Immunity looking very strong and unlikely to lose a map the entire event as displayed by taking out the match convincingly 3-0.





The Losers Bracket didn’t have any close match ups until Round 5. AVANT were up against NoChance and Noxious were up against Fame. After a quick couple of maps NoChance took the early lead 2-1. AVANT looked as though they were at the end of the road but brought the match back winning 3-2. Noxious knocked Fame out 3-1.





Round 6 saw AVANT up against Noxious. AVANT proved to be too much and continued with their momentum taking Noxious out 3-0. 





The Losers Bracket Final was easily the best match up of the weekend. AVANT and Myth had already met in earlier on in the bracket making this a Best of 11 series. With Myth winning their previous match up this gave them a 3-1 advantage going into the match.They were going map for map making it 5-2 with Myth looking as though they had an easy win against AVANT. It was at this point that AVANT decided to take things into their own hands, Hopey and Vamped helped initiate a slew of amazing plays helping AVANT bring the score to 5-5. The final map, Search and Destroy on Cargo, saw teams going round for round early on but AVANT continued with their momentum and with clutch after clutch they took their place in the Grand Final against Immunity.





In the Grand Finals AVANT looked as though they would be able to take it all out after their dominating display against Myth. Unfortunately for them Shockz and Fighter had a very different plan. This duo showed why they are considered the two best players in Australian Call of Duty by showing off their high level of play dropping 50 and 45 kills respectively in Game 1 of the Finals, which layed the foundations of what followed when Immunity beat out AVANT 3-0 further cementing Immunity’s place as the most dominant force Australian Call of Duty has ever scene.





Congratulations to Immunity for taking a very convincing first place in Plantronics ACL Brisbane without dropping a single map. Also congratulations to AVANT.GARDE who had two massive comebacks to make it into the Grand Final and take out second place. 






**Below are the Top 8 results of the tournament:**





1.	Team Immunity


2.	AVANT.GARDE


3.	Myth.WF


4.	Noxious Gaming

6.	Fame

8.	Trident.tb

With 9 teams signed up for Halo 4 at Plantronics ACL Brisbane, players had to fight their way through Pool Play to secure the seeds moving into the Double Elimination Bracket. Going into the event AVANT.GARDE, Elevate, Noxious Gaming and Full Force had proven themselves in Online Rounds being awarded Pro Status which automatically seeded these teams 1st-4th based on their Season 1 Points.





After the battle of Pool Play was all said and done Aura eSports and Pure both tied at the top of the pool with 9 wins and 3 losses. Another Dimension came in at a close 3rd with 7 wins and 5 losses while Domesquad came in 4th place with 5 wins and 7 losses. SuperBestFriends came in last place with a 0-12 record.





Aura and Pure had to play a tiebreaker so determine who would grab the 5th seed moving into the Double Elimination Bracket. This tiebreaker game was a single game of Team Slayer Haven and after what was an intense matchup Pure narrowly edged out Aura with a final score of 50-49.

Winners Bracket Round 1 of the Double Elimination Bracket was pretty tame, with the majority of matches being pretty one-sided. The biggest surprise of the round was Pure upsetting the 4th seeded pro team, Full Force, with a convincing 3-0 victory.





The Winners Bracket Semi-Finals were very one sided as well. Noxious Gaming, our Online Round 2 champions, sent Elevate to the Losers Bracket in a clean sweep 3-0 with AVANT knocking Pure back down to earth 3-0.  In the Winners Bracket Finals the battle of the titans commenced as Noxious defeated the Number 1 seeded, Avant, 3-1 to advance into their second Grand Final in two consecutive tournaments.





Losers Bracket Round 1 was very quick for both Aura and Full Force. Both teams took down their respective opponents 3-0. Losers Bracket Round 2 saw the number 2 seed, Elevate, face the Number 4 seed, Full Force. Elevate had no trouble knocking Full Force out of the competition with a very convincing 3-0. Pure and Aura met again after their epic tiebreaker to take out Pool Play. This time Pure didn’t bring their ‘A’ game with Aura taking the match from them 3-1.





The Losers Bracket Semi-Final had Elevate take on Aura. Aura were looking strong after taking game 1 but that was where they fell short. Their momentum was shut out and they unfortunately went down 3-1 as Elevate booked a spot in the Losers Bracket Final where they would face AVANT.





The Losers Bracket Final saw AVANT and Elevate go head to head for their spot against Noxious in the Plantronics ACL Brisbane Halo 4 Grand Final. AVANT came in as the Number 1 seed and proved they deserved that spot as they took out the match 3-1. This was the end of the road for Elevate who finished off with a respectable 3rd place.





The Grand Final was the best match of the weekend. AVANT and Noxious were going heat to head once again bringing this series to a Best of 11. Noxious were confident after defeating AVANT 3-1 in their match up earlier in the bracket. This gave them the advantage as this score transferred over to the Best of 11 series. Noxious had no problem taking the first 2 games from AVANT bringing the series to 5-1. AVANT decided now was the time to up their game and they fought back with all their might, as displayed by winning the next 2 matches comfortably bringing the series back to 5-3. In game 9 of the series we had Team Slayer on Shutout, a traditionally slow map allowed for an epic match up. Noxious fought it out and managed to pull through taking out the 1st place spot after beating AVANT 50-47 and taking the series 6-3.





A huge congratulation is in order for Noxious Gaming, the Plantronics ACL Brisbane Halo 4 Champions! AVANT.GARDE and Elevate also deserve a pat on the back for their 2nd and 3rd place finishes. 






**Below are the final results of the tournament:**





1.	Noxious Gaming


2.	AVANT.GARDE


3.	Elevate


4.	Aura eSports


5.	Pure


6.	Full Force


7.	Another Dimension


8.	Domesquad
