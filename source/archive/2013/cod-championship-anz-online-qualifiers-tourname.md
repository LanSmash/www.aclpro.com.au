**Call of Duty Champion ANZ Online Qualifiers Tournament Thread**


**This thread contains vital tournament information for both the Australian and New Zealand Online Qualifiers.**





**ABOUT**

ACL Pro is proudly working with Activision to find two of the best teams across Australia and New Zealand to represent the region in the worldwide Call of Duty Championship in Los Angeles April 5-7th. Call of Duty: Black Ops II fans will be able to compete in a series of qualifying events on Xbox 360 with the ultimate chance to play against the best teams in the world for a prize pool of $1,000,000. Both Australian & New Zealand Call of Duty: Black Ops II fans will be able to enter the first online qualifier, with seven teams vying for a chance to attend the Australian and New Zealand Call of Duty Final, presented by Activision, Xbox, and EB Games. In addition, a New Zealand only qualifier will see an eighth and final team join other qualifiers, who all earn a trip to compete in Sydney. Due to ratings and event restrictions, all entrants must be aged 18 years or older through all components of the competition and have a valid passport (with six months validity) by the Australian & New Zealand Final in Sydney.






**TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE**

The COD Championship ANZ Online Qualifiers will host two stages of competition; Pool Play then progressing to a Double Elimination Bracket. Pool Play is on Saturday March 2nd, Double Elimination is on Sunday March 3rd.  Both stages of the tournament start at 12pm (AEDT for Australian Qualifiers, NZDT for New Zealand Qualifiers).






**Pool Play**


Saturday March 2nd will host Pool Play, where all teams will be placed into pools of 4-6 teams and play against every team in their pool. After Pool Play is complete you will have gained a win/loss ratio based on your results against the teams you played in your pool. Once all Pool Play games are done the 
**Top 16**
 teams based on Win/Loss ratio will progress to the second stage of the competition, the Double Elimination bracket. Pools in Pool Play for the Australian Online Qualifier will be seeded by ACL Season 1 points and every Pool will have (as close to as possible) the same amount of points in total to create the fairest possible Pools. For the New Zealand Online Qualifier AvTâ€™s most recent LAN event results will bear significance to those seedings. All Pool Play matches will be Best of 3, meaning you need to play 
**all 3 games**
. If there are any ties for in Win/Loss ratio after Pool Play, a 1 game tie breaker must be played between the teams that are tied. If both teams opt not to play this tie breaker then the team with the highest ACL Season 1 points will be awarded the higher spot out of the two tied teams.






**Double Elimination Bracket**


The Double Elimination Bracket will only see the 
**Top 16**
 teams compete, which unfortunately means any teams that did not earn themselves a top 16 spot be eliminated from the tournament. Seeding for the Double Elimination Bracket will be awarded from the results from Pool Play, ie the team with the best Win/Loss ratio will be seeded 1st in the Double Elimination Bracket. Double Elimination will be Best of 5, which means the first team to win 3 games will progress and you do not play all 5 games unless necessary. In Double Elimination if you lose once, you are knocked down to the Losers Bracket and if you lose again you are knocked out of the tournament. Once the Double Elimination bracket reaches the Top 8, Losers Bracket Round 3, placement matches are 
**compulsory**
. The CoD Championship ANZ LAN Final in Sydney will be seeded off the Online Qualifier Double Elimination results and therefor placements matches must be played within the Top 8 placements. Keep in mind, only 7 teams from the Australian Online Qualifier will progress to the ANZ LAN Final, which unfortunately means the team that places 8th will not compete at the Final event. Also, in the New Zealand Online Qualifier only the winning team will progress to the ANZ LAN Final, unfortunately all other teams will not.
