**The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is in full swing as we come closer to the first National Event, Plantronics ACL Brisbane. ACL Halo 4 Online Round 2 hosted this past weekend went off with a bang and showcased an incredible weekend of Halo boasting some of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand.**




Season and Yearly points were up for the taking so teams had a lot riding on their performance and the result of this weekend. The Australian Cyber League’s second official Halo 4 Online Round was played over the weekend of March 23rd and 24th and we saw some hot talent this weekend with the likes of Avant, Came Saw Conquered, Elevate, Menace to Society and Noxious showing up for the event.





With 25 teams signed up players had to fight their way through Pool Play on Saturday to secure their spot in the Double Elimination Bracket. Only 16 teams could go through so 9 teams would see their competition finished by the end of Saturday. The Double Elimination Bracket came through on Sunday delivering a great playing field for the 16 successful teams who made it through Pool Play. With an incredibly diverse set of teams and great matchups throughout the weekend we were in for some great Halo.





Saturday saw teams separated into 4 pools. The top 12 teams would successfully move through to the Double Elimination Bracket on Sunday where they would meet the top 4 seeded teams Pro teams, based on their Season 1 points.





Aura eSports dominated Pool A without dropping a game, coming through with a 4-0 win ratio. New Era came in at second narrowly missing out on a top finish after losing 1-2 vs. Aura and Full Force came in at 3rd.

 Menace to Society





Winners Bracket Round 1 of the Double Elimination Bracket was pretty tame, with the majority of matches being pretty one-sided. ARISE and Aura kept things interesting by taking their match to the final map. ARISE pulled through and advanced to the next round.





Round 2 saw a lot more excitement. Avant, the number 1 seed, were taken out 3-2 by The Royal D and would have to fight their way through the Losers Bracket. Noxious Gaming also took out a top seeded team, Menace to Society, in another closer 3-2 match up. ARISE and Judgment both had a pretty easy time taking out their matches 3-0 and 3-1 respectively.





The Winners Bracket Semi-Finals were very one sided, Noxious Gaming moving past Royal D 3-1 and Judgement knocking ARISE down to the Losers Bracket 3-0. In the Winners Bracket Finals Noxious showed they weren't slowing down for any team ultimately defeating Judgement 3-1 to secure their place in the Grand Finals.





Now to the Losers Bracket. The Losers Bracket was extremely quick and one sided moving from LBR1 through to LBR4. Every match was either a 3-0 or a 3-1 win for the successful teams. 


It wasn't until LBR5 that we saw any heated matches and some teams out for revenge. Avant and The Royal D were back up against each other, Avant with everything to prove after being knocked to the Losers Bracket by Royal D. Coming into the matchup Royal D were ahead 3-2 however Avant managed to pull back into the series and ultimately took 4 games straight, pushing Royal D out of the tournament with a respectable 4th place finish.





The Losers Bracket Final saw Avant and Judgement go head to head, both teams needing this win to advance to the Grand Final to face Noxious. Avant came in with the momentum off their previous win and proved to be too much for Judgement who unfortunately didn't get a single map on Avant. Avant moved forward to the Grand Final and Judgement were finished for the weekend with a 3rd place placement.





The Grand Final was the best match of the weekend, two excellent teams going head to head to secure crucial Season Points for their win. Noxious were on top of the world going into the Grand Final without dropping a match but Avant were still thriving off of their momentum and took the first match up 3-2. As Noxious went into the Grand Final through the Winners Bracket Avant needed to beat them in two best of five series to walk away the winners, so with Avant taking the first best of five series it was do or die time for Noxious. Noxious fought back in the second best of five series and showed Avant what they were really made of by punishing AVANT 3-0, proving to everyone they were here to stay and that they deserved the crown for ACL Halo 4 Online Round 2 - Season 1.





Big congratulations are in order for Noxious Gaming, who not only won the tournament but also did it coming from Pool Play and taking down the number one seed on their way to victory. Congratulations also to Avant and Judgement on their 2nd and 3rd place finishes. Below is the top 16 final placing’s of the tournament.
