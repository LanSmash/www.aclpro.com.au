**ACL Brisbane After Party!**





**For the first time ever ACL are putting on an Official After Party! 


After what will be a glorious weekend of gaming we wanted to give you a way to relax and see the weekend off.**




The ACL Brisbane After Party will start up as the weekends event comes to a close. It's going to be a great environment to relax and spend some time with the people you know so well online. We are particularly keen as ACL Staff to shake off the wekeend's workload and enjoy a beverage with you all. We encourage you to take the time to talk with us about the event, feedback and the future of competitive gaming!









**What:**

There will be a cash bar open to those who are invited to the ACL Brisbane After Party (shown in the 'Who' section below). This will be a fantastic celebration of the event that just occurred, in a location only metres away from the venue.






**How It Will Work:**


Stage 1:

Pro Players will be invited to join the festivities as soon as the event is wrapped up (sorry - no +1s at this stage).



Stage 2:

Everyone else is encouraged to help make packup a smooth and swift experience, putting their bit in to help ACL. Once the event is completely packed up (or close to it), the After Party will be opened up to those other players or spectators.





Packup can be a very easy (or very painful) experience for ACL's volunteers and this is usually dependant on the number of helpers we have. In the past, only a handful of people have stayed back to help. Together, as a SUPER UNIT, we can smash packup in possibly as short as 45 minutes. Please do what you can to help us in this regard so we can party with you!






**Date/Time:**

Sunday the 14th of April from event close (approx. 7-8pm) until 12 midnight.






**Who:**

*18+ only with legal identification - sorry younger folks!*


ACL Pro Players with a Pro Zone Pass 


Volunteers (after pack up is completed)


Spectators with a wristband (after pack up is completed)


ACL Staff





**As this is a fantastic event with high demand, we will need to monitor WHO is coming into the area carefully. You will need your wristband from the event in order to get in. Do NOT throw this out prematurely
