**ACL Starcraft 2 Online Round 1 - Season 1**





**The 2013 Pro Circuit has just kicked off and ACL is proud to announce its first Starcraft 2 Online Round! Open to unlimited registrations, the competition will be run over one day, with all participants being placed into a double elimination bracket. This tournament will reward participants with valuable season points that will put high placing players in the best position coming into our first Live event of 2013. So warm up your micro and get gaming in preparation for a very important event!**




ACL has recently announced changes in our Pro Circuit structure, including the introduction of Seasons. The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit will be broken down into 3 season, each season ending with a live National event. Our official Online Rounds will seed yourself leading up to National LAN events, where points mean everything. Do you have what it takes to be ranked within the Top 16 leading up to our first National event in April? Here our Top 16 players, the Professional players, will be treated to an exclusive 'Pro Zone' which will be entirely their own. Secluded away from the rest of the Starcraft 2 playing area players will have their group stages live streamed to everybody at home and most importantly secure themselves a place in Group Stages, meaning they will not have to participate in Open Pool Play and will have earned themselves the best possible position to progress to the Championship Bracket and from there take out the tournament. Keep in mind that Season 1, our current Season, will host two official Online Rounds, meaning the Top 16 players ranked by Season points leading into the first National Event will be awarded Pro status, and gain access to all the benefits this title allows. So practice hard, and play your hearts out, because Online Rounds have never been more important!
