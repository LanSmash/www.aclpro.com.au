**Australian Cyber League 2013 Circuit Teaser**





**ACL is pleased to release preliminary details on its 2013 circuit, with a full announcement and live webcast to follow on the topic. 2013 will see some revolutionary changes to its year long event structures, unlike any ACL year before.**




The Australian Cyber League has always been committed to providing the biggest, most exciting and most professional gaming circuit in Australia. Since 2006, we've been on a never-ending learning curve, finding out what the Australian gaming community wants and striving to deliver it.





2013 will bring with it some necessary changes to the ACL circuit. The majority of these changes will be outlined in the ACL 2013 Full Announcement, to be released Monday 10th December. This announcement will be followed by an episode of ACL's In The Zone Webcast on Tuesday, 11th December. This show will feature a Q&A with ACL's CEO Nick Vanzetti, where he'll be taking questions from the community.






**The Changes:**


Until then, ACL would like to provide you with some preliminary plans for 2013. ACL's season structure will undergo some revolutionary changes from its current formats. In the past ACL has held fast to an annual 'year long' season. For the first time ever, we are restructuring the points and season structure to include 4 distinct seasons in 2013. The first season will start in December and be online only, with the first LAN event scheduled for later in the year.
