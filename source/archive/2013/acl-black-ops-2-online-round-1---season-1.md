**ACL Black Ops Online Round 1 - Season 1**





**The 2013 Pro Circuit has just kicked off and ACL is proud to announce their first official Online Round for this blockbuster game! Up first for the CoD community is our first Online Round of Season 1; a free to play one day competition for bragging rights, valuable ACL season and yearly points with additional prizes to be confirmed. Gather your team and compete against the best Australia and New Zealand has to offer in one of the most competitive tournaments for Black Ops 2!**




ACL has recently announced changes in our Pro Circuit structure, including the introduction of Seasons. The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit will be broken down into 3 season, each season ending with a live National event. Our official Online Rounds will seed yourself and your team leading up to National LAN events, where points mean everything. Do you have what it takes to be ranked within the Top 4 leading up to our first National event in April? Here our Top 4 teams, the Professional Teams, will be treated to an exclusive 'Pro Zone' which will be entirely their own. In the Pro Zone teams will be able to practice and scrim against the other Pro teams, have access to showcase matches live streamed to everybody at home, and most importantly secure themselves the Top 4 spots in the Double Elimination bracket, meaning they will not have to participate in Pool Play and will have secured themselves the best possible position to take out the tournament. Keep in mind that Season 1, our current Season, will host two official Online Rounds, meaning the Top 4 teams ranked by Season points leading into the first National Event will be awarded Pro status, and gain access to all the benefits this title allows. So practice hard, and play your hearts out, because Online Rounds have never been more important!






**Details:**


This is the fist official Online Round of Season 1 however Season 1 will host two official Online Rounds. This tournament will award ACL Season 1 points as well as yearly points. Yearly points will seed teams and players at the National FINAL event at the end of year (Season 3), however Season 1 and Season 2 National events will be seeded by their preceding Online Rounds. After Season 1 Online Round 1 & Online Round 2 have been completed, Season points will be added up and used to seed teams at the first live National event in April.
