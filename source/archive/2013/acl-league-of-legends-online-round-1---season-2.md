**ACL League of Legends Online Round 1 - Season 2**





**IMPORTANT: Aatrox is banned for the duration of this tournament.**





**It has been a long time coming and now here it is the first official ACL Online Round for the illustrious title League of Legends! Jumping straight into Season 2 of the ACL Pro Circuit we are coming out in full force hosting two Online Rounds for League of Legends as well as hosting the title at our upcoming ACL Live Event, 
**[Plantronics ACL Melbourne](http://www.aclpro.com.au/forums/topic/20688-plantronics-acl-melbourne/)**! The preceding two Online Rounds (this one, with one more to follow) leading up to Plantronics ACL Melbourne will seed your teams to this invite only event, so sign up, get practicing and prepare yourselves for the 2013 ACL Pro Circuit!**





The 2013 Pro Circuit has kicked off and has now completed its first season. Although League of Legends was not a title throughout Season 1 it is important that LoL players familiarise themselves with our 3 Season structure to have a better understanding moving forward as we look to make League of Legends one of our premier titles. ACL League of Legends Online Round 1 (this event), and ACL League of Legends Online Round 2 (not yet announced) of Season 2, this current season, will award players Season and Yearly Points based on their placement in these tournaments. Plantronics ACL Melbourne, the Live Event of Season 2, is an invite only event for League of Legends and will invite the Top 16 ranked teams based on Season 2 points (Online Round 1 & 2 results) to participate at Melbourne. Similarly, the National FINAL event of 2013, to be hosted in Sydney, will also be invite only however this event will foremost invite teams with the highest Yearly Season Points (Season 2 & Season 3 combined), than on standalone Season 3 points. This 3 Season structure is designed to award teams that succeed in each individual Season leading up to the ACL National FINAL Event where teams that have performed consistently and strongly all year are rewarded the most.





ACL League of Legends Online Round 1 - Season 2 is open to unlimited registrations and will be run over 2 days featuring two different stages of competition. The first leg of the tournament is Pool Play, where teams will be placed in a Pool of 4-6, depending on sign up numbers, in which all teams will play each other in a Round Robbin. Based on win/loss ratio, the Top 16 teams from Pool Play will advance to an Double Elimination Bracket and will play out the bracket until a Champion is crowned. This tournament will reward participants with valuable Season and Yearly Points that will put high placing players in the best position coming into our second Live event of 2013. For this online round we will use existing League of Legends leagues, such as Cybergamer, to ensure that Pool Play is seeded accurately and fairly, giving all teams the best chance to advancing to the Double Elimination bracket.





**Details:**


This is the first of two official Online Rounds of Season 2. This tournament will award ACL Season 2 points as well as yearly points. Yearly points will seed payers at the National FINAL event at the end of year (Season 3), however the Season 2 National events will be seeded by its preceding Online Rounds. After Season 2 Online Round 1 & Online Round 2 have been completed, Season points will be added up and used to seed players at the second live National event in August, Plantronics ACL Melbourne. League of Legends will be added to 
**[Stats Central](http://stats.aclpro.com.au/)**, where players can see their Season and Yearly points updated throughout the year.

**Day/Time:**


**Date:**
 Saturday the 15th of June & Sunday the 16th of June.



**Stages:**
 Saturday: Pool Play, Sunday: Double Elimination, with Double Elimination continuing on Monday night if necessary. 



**Time:**
 10:30am AEST - 10.30pm AEST. 





10.30pm is the latest the tournament will be played to unless all players left agree to continue. If players do not agree to continue matches will be rescheduled at the earliest possible convenience. Players entering and competing in this tournament are obligated to play until AT LEAST 10.30 AEST and if you choose to leave before this time you will be penalised. 






**Tournament Structure:**



**Pool Play:**


Each team will be placed into a Pool of 4-6 teams, depending on signups numbers. In each Pool all teams play each other in a Best of 1 series in a Round Robbin system. Once Pool Play is competed the best performing teams, based on Win/Loss ration, will progress to the Double Elimination Bracket. Teams are not awarded 'no show' wins, meaning if a team does not show up to their match teams are awarded no wins and no losses. In the same fashion, results will only be counted if a teams play 2/3, 3/4 or 4/5 (depending of Pool size) of their scheduled matches. If a team chooses to stop participating before this point all their results will be discounted and teams that competed against teams that leave early will be awarded no wins and no losses for these matches. If uneven numbers dictate that some Pools are required to be larger than others there is no advantage or disadvantage to a small or larger pool, as results are based on a Win/Loss ratio, not a number of games won/lost. For Teams tied after Pool Play seeding will be awarded based on pre-tournament seeding going into the competition, which will see the higher seeded team being awarded the higher seed of the tied teams and the lower seeded team receiving the lower seed. This rule will not count for Teams that tie within the same Pool, as the Team that won out of the two tied teams within the same pool will be awarded the higher seed. Tiebreaker games for tied teams after Pool Play are only required to be played for a position that may determine progressing to the Double Elimination bracket or not, meaning for example if two teams are tied for 16th/17th seed after Pool Play they will be required to play a 1 game tiebreaker instead of pre-tournament seeding determining which team progresses. These Tiebreaker games are to be played Saturday afternoon/evening.






**Double Elimination:**


The Double Elimination bracket will seed the Top 16 teams based on Pool Play results. This stage of the competition will play out like a typical Double Elimination Bracket where teams will have one life in the Winners Bracket, meaning if you lose in the Winners Bracket you drop to the Losers Bracket where you have no lives and are knocked out once beaten in the Losers Bracket. The Double Elimination will host Best of 1 series except for the Grand Final which will host a Best of 3 series. Typical continuation rules will apply in the Double Elimination Bracket and Placement Rounds must also be played to determine exact placements between 16th - 5th.
