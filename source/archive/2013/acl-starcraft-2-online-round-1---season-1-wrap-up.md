**ACL Starcraft 2 Online Round 1 - Season 1 Wrap Up!**


**Written by Baldie**





**ACL Starcraft 2 is back in action in 2013 having just seen the completion of the first of two online rounds for season 1. On Sunday 9th February, 74 players entered a double elimination bracket to fight through a total of 147 best of 3 sets. It was sure to be a great day of Starcraft 2 action.**




Starcraft 2 will take a new shape in 2013 for ACL with the implementation of a pro players corner as well as various other point based incentives which were not available in 2012. Featuring some of the best players of Australia and New Zealand including arguably Australia's biggest talent in GAMECOM Nv mOOnGLaDe, along with New Zealand's superstar Frenetic Array Petraeus, earning those valuable ACL points was never going to be easy.





The structure of the tournament saw every set be a best of 3, allowing players to have the best chance of showcasing their talent in each matchup. Seeding took place using data from 2012, with all future online rounds being seeded by season points in 2013. Although rewarding those who played in ACL events in 2012, for players such as Xeria Gaming KingKong who arrived in Australia late last year were forced to fight from the bottom of the seeded bracket.





First and second round games saw many expected wins but also a number of upsets. Frenetic Array Iaguz went into the tournament seeded 4th, qualifying him for a second round birth. Evidently his first match of the day would be none other than KingKong. Going into the set to many as the underdog, Iaguz dropped the first map on Ohana unable to hold an infestor and roach timing. Moving into the second map on Entombed Valley Iaguz didn't falter showcasing some amazing triple pronged attacks and shredding through KingKong's forces. Daybreak would be the 3rd and final map and once again Iaguz was able to dictate the flow of the game denying expansions while defending his own knocking KingKong into the lower bracket and showing the community he was here for blood. Iaguz continued his run taking out Exile 5 Frustration 2-0 before succumbing to AVANT Pox 1-2. In the lower bracket we saw a rematch against KingKong where he once again was able to win 2-1 in another great set before being taken out of the tournament by Xeria Gaming Poker 1-2.

Another big talking point was the set between GAMECOM Nv mOOnGLaDe and Immunity Light in the Round of 8 Winners Bracket. Neither player had dropped a single map leading up to their set and with Light being a reliable results producer for Protoss it was sure to be a set not to miss. A great first map was showcased on Daybreak with a maxed army fight between both players. Light pulled the trigger and went for an attack with a healthy unit composition and with some nice micro was able to take down the infestors and broodlords of mOOnGLaDe and eventually the game. Map 2 saw us move to Antiga Shipyard with Light looking to end the set swiftly with a 7 gate all-in. mOOnGLaDe with a quick response piled on the roaches and was able to narrowly hold off the attack and took the map. Third map not surprisingly was Cloud Kingdom as chosen by Light. Another great showcase of talent saw Light hit a nice timing as mOOnGLaDe's infestors hit the field and had too much muscle with a healthy immortal count. Eventually mOOnGLaDe was forced to tap out and was knocked into the lower bracket. mOOnGLaDe continued his run in the lower bracket before eventually being knocked out by Petraeus in the Lower Bracket Semi Finals.

Auxiliary MegaFonzi was another head turner throughout the day taking out Kez 2-0, Iris MightyKiwi 2-0 and most surprisingly in many eyes Immunity Mafia 2-0. Without dropping a single set he was met by PiG in Winner Bracket Semis where he was defeated 0-2. PiG later tweeted:  "MegaFonzie is really, really good. new SEA protoss powerhouse to come from Hobart?" Knocked into the lower bracket he was met by mOOnGLaDe who ended his run with a 2-0 victory. There is no doubt we will see more of MegaFonzi in major South East Asian and ACL events. Definitely somebody to keep an eye on in 2013!

With the day drawing to a close the field of 74 was reduced to just 3: Petraeus, PiG and Light. Light, having taken out PiG in the Winner Bracket Finals had already guaranteed himself a position in the final set. Having just taken out mOOnGLaDe 2-0, Petraeus was showing very strong signs of taking out the entire tournament. First map in this last ZvZ was Daybreak and with it a very aggressive game. PiG was the first to engage making a handful of zerglings and banelings off 2 base following up with a roach baneling all-in. Managing to break through Petraeus' defenses PiG was able to take the first map. Map two saw us move to Cloud Kingdom and the roles reversed it seemed. Petraeus opting for a 9 pool to apply some early aggression following up with a 2-base zergling baneling all-in. PiG without his own baneling nest was unable to defend and tapped out forcing a third and final game on Ohana. The third map proved to be one of the best ZvZ's of the day with plenty of back and forth action. PiG with his roach baneling against Petraeus with his Roach, Hydralisk and Infestor  composition clashed heads and with some clutch fungals on a clump of PiG's banelings they were unable to connect on the Hydralisks of Petraeus and PiG was forced to GG out.

The grand finals were somewhat anticlimactic to what was a great tournament. Light was originally unable to continue playing into the final set so the win was given through walkover to Petraeus. There were talks of a rematch at a later date but that need not eventuate as Light was amazingly able to find enough time to play the set out. With clearance from VaNzR the finals were played out off stream where Light was able to reclaim his spot as 1st.
