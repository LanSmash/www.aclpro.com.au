**Tournament Structure:**


This tournament will host Pool Play on Saturday with the Top 12 teams, based off win/loss ratio, moving onto a Double Elimination Bracket on Sunday. The Pools will be made based off existing Season 2 points received during Online Round 3. As competitors should know each Season has its own separate Season points, so while pools are seeded on Season 2 Points, there are 4 Pro Teams for Season 2 and they will not need to play pool play. 
***If less than 16 teams sign up, all teams will be required to participate in Pool Play.**





You will not be awarded forfeit wins for teams that do not show up to Pool Play.





Placement Matches 
**MUST**
 be played in the Double Elimination Bracket. If you choose not to play in your Placement Matches then you forfeit your chance to place the highest position available once knocked out and consequently will be awarded less ACL Season and Yearly points.






**Gametypes:**


This tournament will use the V4 settings. These can be found in the fileshare of "ACLPRO COM AU"
