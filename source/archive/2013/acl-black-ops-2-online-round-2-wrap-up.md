**The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit is in full swing as we come closer to the first National Event, Plantronics ACL Brisbane. This past Saturday we played host to the second official Call of Duty Online Round of 2013; ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 2. We saw an impressive talent pool of 35 teams from across Australia and New Zealand battle it out in the hopes of claiming the top spot as their own.**




Up for grabs were valuable Season and Yearly points giving teams plenty to fight for and plenty to prove. The competition fielded the best names in Australia and New Zealand Call of Duty including the likes of Avant, Mindfreak, Winning Formula, Noxious and the recent National CoD Championship winners, Team Immunity.





This tournament hosted no Pool Play so teams jumped straight into a Double Elimination Bracket with seeds awarded from ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 1. With teams changing members and new teams signing up this allowed for quite a diverse range of teams at a range of seeds, in turn this created a wonderful lineup of matches which saw the tournament go off throughout the day.





Notable match ups from Round 1/Round 2 would include Team Emperor vs Defy, where Emperor would walk away after a nail-biting 3-2 series and Plague vs Team Legacy, where Team Legacy were just edged out 3-2 by Plague. The highlight match from Winners Bracket Round 2 however would have to be Cert4 vs Noxious where Cert4 were down in the series 2-0 and managed to claw their way back to a 3-2 finish. Most other matches in Round 1/Round 2 had a pretty standard 3-0/3-1 result.









**Cert4 show they were not willing to give up when being 2-0 down**





Winners Bracket Round 3 almost saw a 100% clean sweep with 7/8 teams advancing through winning their respective matches 3-0. NtenZity were the only team to put a round on their opponent, Mindfreak but it still wasn't enough for them to progress through to Winners Bracket Round 4.





Winners Bracket Round 4 saw Immunity continue their dominance dismissing Carrion in a 3-0 fashion while the up and coming Winning Formula punishing Mindfreak 3-0 also. Team NOCHANCE cleaned up Cert4 3-1 and Avant narrowly pushing Myth eSports to the Losers bracket with a 3-2 win.









**Immunity not slowing down for Carrion**





Up next we had Winners Round 5, or the Winners Bracket Semi-Finals. Winning Formula were riding on the back of their previous 3-0 win and didn't want to give NOCHANCE the thrill of a close match. Winning Formula smashed NOCHANCE into the Losers Bracket 3-0. Team Immunity arrived against Avant who came into the series wanting to end Immunity's win streak. Avant put up a tremendous 2 rounds giving Immunity the sweats but it wasn't enough to push Immunity to the losers bracket. Immunity walked away with a 3-2 win giving them a spot in the Winners Bracket Finals.





With Team Immunity and Winning Formula in the Winners Bracket Final both teams were fighting for their spot in the Grand Final. Immunity wiped the sweat from their previous match, installed their dehumidifiers and gave Winning Formula a slaying. Taking the Winners Bracket Final 3-0, Immunity secured their spot in the Grand Final.





Down to the final stages of the Losers Bracket, Losers Bracket Round 6 was Mindfreak saying goodbye to Cert4 by knocking them out the tournament with a 3-1 result and Carrion surprising a lot of on-lookers and probably Myth as well by taking down Myth 3-1, showing what Carrion are cable when on fire. In Losers Bracket round 7 Avant got revenge on the team that stopped them heading over to LA for the CoD Championship finals by giving Mindfreak a swift 3-0, handing Mindfreak their 6th place finish.









**Avant get their revenge on Mindfreak**





Up next in Losers Bracket Round 8 was one of the highlight series of the tournament between Avant and Carrion. After Carrion's dominate display against Myth they carried on that momentum to take Avant to a 5 game series, narrowly losing 3-2. All players in this series took turns stepping up and pulling off huge plays, none perhaps as much as Ray from Carrion, who showed off some mouse-like aim with his impressive shot. 









**Carrion nearly pulling off a massive upset**





The Losers Bracket Final saw Winning Formula go up against Avant for a chance to play Immunity in the Grand Finals. Both teams came out hot and on-fire as Avant took game one, however Winning Formula answered right back taking game two and then next two games after to take the series 3-1 which awarded Avant a respectable third place finish. With Winning Formula and Immunity being the only teams left out of 35 of Australia and New Zealand's best it was an incredible feat to get this far, however both teams had their eyes on that number 1 spot. After Immunity had to wait in the Grand Finals for the Losers Bracket to play out it was questionable if that wait would affect their performance. Whether it be the result of a cold Immunity or a strong Winning Formula we saw Winning Formula taking out Game 1 S&D Aftermath 6-4 in the Grand Finals, making the series score 3-1 to Immunity in a continuation series. Determined to show Winning Formula what Immunity was capable of Immunity answered back and answered back strong taking the next 3 games of the series HP Raid 250-147, HP Standoff 250-65 and S&D Meltdown 6-3 in a dominating fashion. So ended ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 2 - Season 1 and one of the largest Black Ops 2 tournaments Australia & New Zealand has seen yet.
