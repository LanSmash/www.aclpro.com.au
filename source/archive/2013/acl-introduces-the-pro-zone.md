**ACL Introduces the Pro Zone**





**For the first time ever at an ACL national event, we are looking to reward the pro players that put the most time and energy into our competitions. By providing specialist Pro Zone areas at our Plantronics ACL event this April 13th and 14th in Brisbane, those elite players will receive a few extra perks that should help them to relax and focus on their game. This is just a part of what ACL is trying to accomplish in recognising the heroes of our games and rewarding our most loyal followers.**




ACL has long been trying to raise the profile of our Pro Players, at the same time giving our newer players something to strive to achieve. We watch our foreign counterparts celebrate in the efforts their pro players put in and we believe the least we can do is to give some level of status and perks to those that work hard to achieve results in our competitions. In a similar vein, don't forget that the last event of this year for ACL is an invite only event, focusing on the spectator experience and the final battle of our professional players for the crown of 2013 champions. Let's now take a look at some further details of the Plantronics ACL Brisbane Pro Zone.









**What do they get?**

So what does this mean for our Pro Players? What perks are on offer?





- Exclusive Pro Zone competition areas: separate, roped off area of play


- Exclusive Pro Zone breakout room: A quiet retreat for Pro Players to take a breath, regroup and focus. Each Player is allowed a +1 to gain entry to the breakout room with them also.


- Exclusive Early Access to the official ACL After Party (to be announced separately soon)


- Free energy drinks or bottled water


- Internet access to post/comment and update their fans via social media in the Pro Zone break room


- A Pro Pass for the Pro Zone to keep (as shown below) that allows Pros access to the exclusive areas
