**ACL officially welcomes League of Legends to 2013 ACL Pro Circuit!**





**It has been a long time coming and finally ACL is proud to announce that we have picked up the powerhouse title League of Legends for the 2013 ACL Pro Cricuit! A MOBA title has been on the cards since early 2013 (the great debate can be seen 
**[here](https://www.facebook.com/aclpro/posts/10151420202578092)**) and with the unbeatable global popularity of Riot's title we are thrilled to confirm League of Legends is our MOBA of choice!  Since the inception of ACL we have always been committed to providing the Australian gaming community with the best possible competitive gaming experience and we are very excited to extend our experience and expertise to our newest title, League of Legends!**





**ACL League of Legends Online Round 1 - Season 2:**

Australian Cyber League will host their first Online Round for League of Legends on the 16th of June and like all titles Season 2 will host two Online Rounds for League of Legends. After each Online Round the individual players from teams are awarded Season Points, which will accumulate leading into ACL Melbourne. A full separate announcement will be released shortly for Online Round 1 however for now save the date, as this Online Round is the first stepping stone on the road to the League of Legends tournament hosted at our National Live Event - ACL Melbourne.





For those interested, we are working closely with CyberGamer much like we do for our Call of Duty events and are committed to a strong partnership in this regard. Our events won't conflict, we will have a close tie-in with admins and our overarching programs will complement each other. 






**ACL Melbourne:**

We are wasting no time trying to give League of Legends the live event exposure in Australia it deserves by hosting the title at our upcoming ACL Melbourne Live Event. The exact date for ACL Melbourne, including venue details and all other information, will be released early next week! Stay tuned for full details of this event soon.






**We are extremely excited to welcome League of Legends to the ACL family and promise to dedicate ourselves to helping build the already thriving and vibrant LoL community in Australia. We hope to see all of you sign up for our Online Rounds in Season 2 and see your faces come ACL Melbourne!**
