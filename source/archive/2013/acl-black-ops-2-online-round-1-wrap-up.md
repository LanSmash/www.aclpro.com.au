**The 2013 ACL Pro Circuit has kicked off! This Sunday just gone played host to ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 1 - Season 1, our first official Call of Duty Online Round of 2013, which fielded an impressive talent pool of 35 teams. Coming into Black Ops 2 lots of teams and players are trying to claw their way to the top and this tournament proved to be a perfect testing ground to show which teams will shine in 2013.**




With the opportunity for teams to gain valuable Season and Yearly points, the Australian Cyber Leagueâ€™s first Black Ops 2 Online Round event came to a thrilling conclusion last Sunday, February 10th. Featuring some of the best teams in Australia and New Zealand including the likes of Unite, Cruelty Incarnate, Seraphix Nexus, Ignition and Auxiliary the competition was set to be a fierce one.





As there was no Pool Play and no seeds coming into this tournament, the competition would start with the Bracket being drawn randomly, with all future Online Rounds being seeded by Season points and previous tournament placements. With 35 teams registered, there was quite a variety of match ups in Round 1 and it made for some very interesting competition.





Notable match ups from Round 1/Round 2 would include Aura eSports vs Pongsu, where auRa would walk away after a nail-biting 3-2 series and Initiate vs Doritos Crash Course Superstars, where DCCS's awesome name wasn't enough to stop them just being edged out 3-2 by Initiate. Teams such as Unite, Cruelty Incarnate, Seraphix Nexus, Auxiliary, Cert 4 in Durry Rollering and Myth all breezed past their initial opponents, not dropping a map.





Winners Bracket Round 3 was full of some dominating victories and some heart breaking defeats. Influence, despite putting up a valiant fight, dropped down 3-2 to Cruelty Incarnate and NtenZity unfortunately didn't have what it takes on the day to beat Myth, also bowing into the losers bracket after losing 3-2. Outbreak, Serphix Nexus, Auxiliary, Aura, Cert 4 in Durry Rollering and Unite all smashed their way through Winners Bracket Round 3, winning 3-0 or 3-1 respectively.  





Winners Round 4 saw Unite being the only team left in the tournament not to drop a game, taking down Myth with relative ease 3-0. Seraphix Nexus managed to edge out Auxiliary 3-2, Cert 4 in Durry Rollering took out Aura eSports 3-1 and Cruelty Incarnate showed off a 3-1 win over Outbreak.





Up next we had Winners Round 5, or the Winners Bracket Semi-Finals. Unite came out strong once again making a statement and showing they are a force to be reckoned with, taking out Cert 4 in Durry Rollering 3-0. Cruelty Incarnate on the other hand suffered what was probably the most heart breaking loss of the tournament. After being 2-0 up over Seraphix Nexus, they unfortunately could not hold their composure and managed to let game by game slip past them, losing out Game 5 with a margin of 209 - 222 in Hardpoint. 















**Full series of Cruelty Incarnate vs Serphix Nexus**




With Unite and Seraphix Nexus left as the only two teams still standing in the Winners Bracket, they were forced to battle in the Winners Bracket Finals for a spot in the Grand Finals. Game 1 was Harpoint on Raid and saw both teams fighting for early control of the Hardpoints. Serpahix Nexus lead majority of the match till 189 points, where Unite with the help of Buzzin and his killstreaks took the lead and didn't let up taking out game 1 216-208. Game 2, Search and Destroy Express, was another hard fought and close match. With each team going practically going round for round, up until 4-4 where Unite managed to pull away 6-4. Game 3, Capture the Flag Standoff, saw Unite take the first half 2-1, also scoring another flag in the second half, to defeat Seraphix Nexus with a final score of 3-1. Unfortunately for Seraphix Nexus, this sent them to the Losers Bracket while Unite was sitting pretty in the Grand Finals.

Meanwhile, in the Losers Bracket, many teams were struggling to find their feet. Ignition, after dropping down to the Losers Bracket from their first series, managed to have an incredible run past Cmen Hunters, ADAMANT, Obelisk and Outbreak, only dropping 1 game in that duration. It wasn't until Losers Bracket Round 6 where they were finally stopped by Auxiliary, being defeated 3-0. The other Losers Bracket Round 6 match up hosted a rematch between Aura and Pongsu, with Aura managing to knock out Pongsu with a score of 6-4 in a continuation series. 





Down to the final stages of the tournament now with only 6 teams left, it was make or break time for teams wishing to prove themselves. Cert 4 in Durry Rollering, despite their comical name, managed to take down the skilled Auxiliary squad 3-0, sending Auxiliary home with a 6th place finish. Cruelty Incarnate, bouncing back from their rough defeat against Seraphix Nexus, showed they still had signs of life handing Aura their 5th place finishing, defeating Aura 3-1. From these two victors, only one would progress to play Seraphix Nexus in the Losers Bracket Final, and that would be Cert 4 in Durry Rollering, knocking out Cruelty Incarnate from the tournament and handing them a respectable 4th place finish.





And then there were three! It was Losers Bracket Final time and we saw a fierce Seraphix Nexus squad, coming off a rough loss against Unite, going up against Cert 4 in Durry Rollering who were pulling off upset after upset in every round. Game 1, Hardpoint Slums, went 250-186 in Cert 4's favour. Game 2, Search and Destory Cargo, went down to the wire. Tied 5-5, each team traded player for player until it was only Fate and Genji left, with Fate managing to secure the last kill of the round and game on Genji, and get the defuse to win the match. Game 3, Capture the Flag Standoff, saw Seraphix Nexus run away with the match 6-0 and secure themselves a spot in the Final against Unite. Cert 4, although defeated by Seraphix Nexus, earned a prestigious 3rd place.





Grand Final time! Well this one ended a bit differently then we'd like our tournaments to end. Both teams came out fighting in Game 4 in a continuation series in the Final. Unite showed their form had not be altered by the waiting time, going up 4-0 in the finals after winning Hardpoint Standoff 250-166. Game 5 however, showed Unite being handed their first loss of the tournament, being defeated by Seraphix Nexus 6-4 in Search and Destory Raid. However the next match, Capture the Flag Express, would happen to be the last match of the Finals and the tournament as Beastn, from Seraphix Nexus, unfortunately had to leave. Unable to continue to field 4 players, Seraphix Nexus had no choice but to bow out of the tournament at second place, making Unite the ACL Black Ops 2 Online Round 1 - Season 1 champions!
