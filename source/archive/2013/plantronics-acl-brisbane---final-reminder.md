**Pro Teams at Plantronics ACL Brisbane:**

Pro Teams at Plantronics ACL Brisbane are treated to the Pro Zone and all the benefits that come with the title of being Pro. We however need to stress that even though Pro Teams do not participate in Pool Play they are still required to participate in 'Pro Showmatches' while Pool Play is running. The Pro Showmatches will start at 1pm and be streamed from this time onwards, for this reason we ask Pro Teams to arrive to the venue no later than 12pm. Pro Teams are ofcourse welcome to come as early as they want and set up, practice against other pro teams or spectate the event, however the ABSOLUTE latest Pro Teams can arrive is 12pm. This information is labelled clearly in the Event Schedule found
